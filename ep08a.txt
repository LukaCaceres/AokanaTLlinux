After my long heart-to-heart conversation with Aoi-san...
...I had an extremely vivid dream.
It was the same dream I started having after the summer tournament. One full of hope where I was flying through the sky.
A dream where I spread out my arms, faced upward, and flew as far as my wings could take me as the wind caressed my body.
At first, I couldn't understand why that scene kept repeating in my mind.
I thought that I might have been using it to vent my stress on some subconscious level.
But eventually, I realized that was wrong.
Because in those dreams, I was holding a girl's hand.
And it was an incredibly warm, comforting hand. So warm, in fact, that I felt it set my heart ablaze.
Whenever I looked at the girl in my dreams, I heard her say, "I'm having a lot fun right now."
And I replied in kind.
Simply being by her side, and flying with her, was enough to keep me facing ever upward.
Ultimately, no matter what struggles I faced, I always returned to this dream. It was the only place I could see that strong, kind smile, so I really had no other choice.
The sheer warmth of it all made me think I was flying close to the sun.
【Masaya】
Asuka.
I call out to her in my dreams.
She's the girl I love, the girl who helped me beat back my longstanding depression.
【Masaya】
......
I realize I'm missing my blanket when I wake up.
And as I think more, I remember everything that happened yesterday, as well as everything from my dreams.
【Masaya】
Man...
【Masaya】
This is kinda embarrassing...
A smile rises to my face despite how self-conscious I feel.
Well, whatever. I'm up already, so I guess I'll head to school early.
【Masaya】
Feels weird being up this early...
I see my right hand when I'm about to get out of bed.
The sunlight's shining right onto its palm, which makes it feel hot.
【Masaya】
Oh, I see.
That explains the dream.
【Masaya】
No one's out this early, huh?
I'm only 30 minutes ahead of my normal schedule, but there isn't a single soul in sight.
【Masaya】
A kindergarten bus normally passes by...
A bus usually rolled past me as I walked toward school.
And further down, I'd see some kindergarten teachers with some kids.
【Masaya】
And around here, I run into some elementary schoolers...
I turn the corner while expecting them to dash right into me and...
【Asuka】
Ah...!
【Masaya】
Ah!
Didn't expect this... Damn, what do I even say?
【Asuka】
G-Good morning!
【Masaya】
Y-Yeah, good morning...
We awkwardly bob our heads as we greet each other.
【Asuka】
Y-You're out here early today, Masaya-san.
【Masaya】
Oh, yeah. Figured I'd head to school, since I woke up early and all.
【Asuka】
Oh, I see... Haha, ahaha...
God, this small talk is so cringy...
【Masaya】
So, about yesterday...
【Asuka】
Ah!
My words seem to trigger something in Asuka.
In an instant, her face is bright red.
【Masaya】
U-Um, Asuka...?
【Asuka】
Wh-Wh-What about yesterday...?
Why's she getting all flustered?
【Masaya】
(Oh... I see.)
She probably thinks I'm talking about how we confessed to each other. My bad.
I just wanted to tell her about my talk with Aoi-san, but obviously she wouldn't have guessed.
【Masaya】
Oh, uh, what happened yesterday... um, made really happy... Thanks.
Since we're on the topic already, it's better to just talk about it.
I know it's weird to thank her, but that's gotta be better than trying to awkwardly change the topic, right?
【Asuka】
Y-Yes, um, me too...
【Asuka】
I also felt very, very happy...
Crap... Asuka looks <i>really</i> cute right now.
The way she's acting all shy by looking back and forth between me and the ground is driving me nuts...
I swear, I'd hug her right here and now if no one else was around.
【Masaya】
(Wait, we're actually all alone...)
Ugh, forget that. Point is, my love for her is overwhelming me.
Don't know if I could actually work up the courage to embrace her, but that doesn't really matter.
【Masaya】
Do you usually walk to school around this time?
Asuka nods.
【Asuka】
Yes, pretty much every day.
【Masaya】
Damn. I'm impressed. I could never manage that.
【Asuka】
Well, I was almost late on my first day, remember?
【Masaya】
Oh, yeah.
That was a close call.
We had to fly at top speed, and we still just barely made it.
【Asuka】
That's why I started leaving earlier. I hate the idea of being late.
【Masaya】
One little mistake's changed your way of life, huh? Cool.
Maybe I should take a page out of her book...
【Asuka】
Oh, but...
【Masaya】
Yeah?
【Asuka】
I wouldn't have met you if I wasn't running late, so...
【Asuka】
...It wasn't all bad, I guess.
【Asuka】
Ah...! Wh-What did I just say? J-Just forget it all!
Man, she's really, <i>really</i> cute!
【Asuka】
Um, so, what should we do?
【Masaya】
What do you mean?
【Asuka】
We, um... started dating yesterday, right?
【Masaya】
Y-Yeah...
It's a little embarrassing when she puts it like that, but she's not wrong.
【Asuka】
What should we tell the others?
【Masaya】
Oh...
Shit.
【Masaya】
Yeah, I mean, keeping quiet... is probably a bad idea...
【Asuka】
Yeah... Still, how do we tell them?
Good question. Let's see, announcing at a meeting would be pretty tacky...
...Guess our only choice is to tell each of them individually.
【Masaya】
Let me handle it.
【Asuka】
Are you sure that's okay?
【Masaya】
Yeah. It'd probably be harder for you, right?
【Asuka】
T-True...
Okay, so I've gotta tell everyone. That's easy enough, but when?
It'll get harder the longer I wait, so as soon as possible, I guess?
【Misaki】
Morning.
【Masaya】
H-Hi...
【Asuka】
Good morning, Misaki-chan.
Great. I already sound like a total weirdo.
If I keep this up, she'll figure it all out on her own...
【Misaki】
Oh, you guys came in together. Weird...
【Madoka】
Good point. You usually show up at different times.
【Asuka】
......
【Asuka】
Y-Y-Y-Y-You're right! We just happened to run into each other on the way! T-Tell them, Masaya-san!
【Masaya】
Y-Yeah, what a weird coincidence. Hahaha...
【Misaki】
Guess that makes sense, since you usually come at different times.
【Madoka】
I think that's great. It means you two are getting more in sync, which'll help with FC.
【Masaya】
Y-You said it! Hahaha... (Man, that was close.)
Guess we managed to pull the wool over their eyes?
It was probably just an offhand comment, but Misaki nearly gave me a heart attack there!
【Misaki】
Oh, Madoka. You have a handout for Mashiro, don't you?
【Madoka】
You're right! I'll go give it to her right now. Wanna tag along?
【Misaki】
Yeah, better get it out of the way. Aight, we'll be back soon.
【Masaya】
You do that.
【Asuka】
See you in a bit.
【Madoka】
We'll be right back!
【Masaya】
Pheeeeeew...!
【Asuka】
Pheeeeeew...!
What a relief.
【Asuka】
Th-They didn't catch on, did they?
【Masaya】
B-Based on their reactions, we should be fine.
We got by on the skin of our teeth.
Though, honestly, I don't wanna keep doing this, so I'd better tell everyone fast.
【Masaya】
I'll talk to Madoka after practice.
【Asuka】
Good idea...
【Misaki】
...What's your take?
【Madoka】
...It's a little gray, but almost black.
【Misaki】
Way I see it, there's no doubt.
【Madoka】
I've been waiting for something to happen since that Iron Mall visit. It's good to know they finally made some progress.
【Mashiro】
When did he manage to make a move?
【Misaki】
What are we gonna do? It'd be fun to mess around with them...
【Mashiro】
Time for some exciting questions! Like, asking Masaya-senpai, "Asuka-senpai sure is cute, isn't she?" Or wait, I know, we can watch them as they gaze into each other's eyes!
【Misaki】
I've got a ton of ideas. I'll talk to Asuka and say, "Wow, Masaya's been acting <i>way</i> more cool lately!" Or no, maybe I'll go with, "Hey, do you think I should hurry up and confess to Masaya already?"
【Madoka】
Well, knowing them, they'll probably just act all embarrassed. Let's keep the teasing to just today. We can tell them we know after practice.
【Misaki】
Seriously? <i>Come on,</i> I need at least three days to get this stuff out of my system!
【Mashiro】
A week sounds better to me!
【Madoka】
Are you two sadists...? No, we're going with my plan.
【Misaki】
Boooooo!
【Madoka】
No booing. You guys are going to listen to me, got it?
【Misaki】
Fiiine...
【Mashiro】
Understood.
【Masaya】
Okay, let's start today's meeting.
【Misaki】
Hmmmmmm...
【Masaya】
Why are you staring at me, Misaki?
She isn't trying to mess with me, right?
【Misaki】
Nah, it's nothing.
【Misaki】
It's just, you look a lot more cool lately.
【Asuka】
Ah...!
【Masaya】
Wh-Why bring that up?
【Misaki】
Don't you agree, Asuka?
【Asuka】
Huuuuuuh?!
【Asuka】
I-I, um, I, I, uh, um...
...Cool it, Asuka! You're getting <i>way</i> too flustered.
【Masaya】
Why are you asking her that? That's pretty damn weird.
【Misaki】
Huh? I mean, she's kinda like your disciple, yeah? That means she's probably watching you more.
Misaki's clearly up to something.
【Masaya】
(Is this all a joke to her, or does she know?)
Maybe I should just tell them now. Though, that might ruin the rest of the meeting...
【Mashiro】
Come to think of it, I feel like Asuka-senpai's gotten a lot cuter.
【Masaya】
Why are you playing along with Misaki's joke?
【Mashiro】
Don't you agree, Masaya-senpai?
【Masaya】
Huh? Oh, I, um...
【Asuka】
Ah...! Hm...
【Masaya】
...Quit staring at me, Asuka.
【Asuka】
Oh, I-I'm sorry... I couldn't help myself!
Man, at this rate, it's only a matter of time before they find out.
Why are Misaki and Mashiro doing this? There <i>has</i> to be a good reason.
【Masaya】
What are you two trying to pull?
【Misaki】
Nothing.
【Mashiro】
Nothing at all.
God, they're acting more suspicious than us!
【Madoka】
Okay, that's enough. It's the manager's turn to speak.
【Masaya】
Sure... go ahead.
What's she gonna do?
【Madoka】
Um, you two are dating, aren't you?
【Masaya】
Huh?!
【Asuka】
Eek!
【Misaki】
I knew this would happen...
【Mashiro】
Yeah, it's honestly a little boring. I wish they would've done something different.
【Madoka】
I know, right?
【Masaya】
What the... How long have you guys--
【Shion】
Sorry I'm late! Class ran long!
【Misaki】
Ugh...
【Mashiro】
Eek!
【Asuka】
Ah...
【Shion】
Why are you guys acting so weird?
【Madoka】
Do a 180 and walk right out that door, Shion!
【Shion】
Why?!
【Shion】
I see... Hinata and Kurashina, huh? That's nice...
【Madoka】
What's with that boring reaction? You sound like someone's uncle.
【Misaki】
Well, we can leave questions about how it all went down for later, so...
【Mashiro】
Tell us what you like about him!
【Asuka】
I-I need to answer that?!
【Misaki】
Definitely!
【Mashiro】
Absolutely!
【Asuka】
Oh no... U-Um, what I love most is...
【Masaya】
You <i>don't</i> have to answer, Asuka. Hey, guys, quit pressuring her!
【Misaki】
Wow, Masaya's barking orders like a real drill sergeant.
【Mashiro】
What a jerk...
【Masaya】
Seriously?
【Madoka】
Okay, that's enough. The people from Takafuji will be here soon, so go get changed.
【Misaki】
'Kaaay. Asuka, let's talk while we get changed!
【Asuka】
Uhhh...
【Mashiro】
Are things a little different when you're alone?
【Masaya】
Hey!
【Masaya】
Good job. Now go for a string of moves while you're there.
【Asuka】
Understood!
【Masaya】
Shindou-san, please focus on dodging Asuka's attacks. Oh, but try to get behind her for an attack at the same time, too.
【Shindou】
Got it, Hinata-kun... Come at me whenever you're ready, Kurashina-kun!
【Asuka】
Understood! Here I go!
Our zigzag string is starting to look good, so now we're trying to predict what Saki Inui's reaction would be.
Shindou-san creates the Bird Cage, then when the pressure from Asuka gets to be too much, he breaks away and shoots for the buoy.
Asuka then jumps to the next line, blocks Shindou-san's path, and reverses their roles. That's the response we came up with.
I'm using Inui's match from the other day as reference to carefully craft the most efficient and strategic options for Asuka.
【Shindou】
Ugh... You're much faster now, Kurashina-kun!
【Asuka】
Oh no, I'm still nowhere near fast enough!
At this point, they're equals... No, wait, I guess it's more accurate to say Shindou-san's finally breaking a sweat.
【Madoka】
"It's true that she had enormous latent potential all along, but her growth is simply astonishing!"
【Madoka】
...Coach Hinata stated with great satisfaction!
【Masaya】
Quit trying to guess my thoughts, Madoka.
【Madoka】
I wasn't that far off the mark, right?
【Masaya】
...I guess.
Asuka must seem like a prodigy to most folks.
And I'm sure that goes double for Madoka, who serves as our manager.
【Masaya】
Hey, Madoka.
【Madoka】
What?
【Masaya】
Sorry I started dating Asuka...
I know this must be hard for her.
I mean, a coach dating one of their players is wrong on so many levels, and it doesn't help that we have an important tournament coming up.
She's our manager, so it probably irritates her most.
【Madoka】
Don't apologize. Honestly, I'm glad it happened.
【Masaya】
Wait, really?
【Madoka】
Yeah. Asuka-chan's been in love with you this whole time.
【Madoka】
It's good that she doesn't have to hold back anymore.
【Masaya】
W-Wait, what? How long has she liked me?
【Madoka】
Huh? Hold on, are you saying you didn't know? Seriously?! You must've had some idea!
【Masaya】
No, not at all...
【Madoka】
......
【Madoka】
Hey, Hinata-kun, why don't you bring your forehead a little closer to me?
【Masaya】
What do you--? Ouch!
【Masaya】
What do you--?
【Masaya】
Ouch!
【Madoka】
I'm punishing you in Asuka's place.
【Masaya】
I-I didn't do anything wrong!
【Madoka】
You <i>totally</i> did! Being dense is a sin, Hinata-kun.
【Masaya】
Ugh...
【Madoka】
Well, putting aside the fact that you're as dense as a black hole, I'm happy for Asuka-chan.
【Masaya】
But I'm her coach, so this is...
【Madoka】
Who cares? You aren't going to stop dating now, are you?
【Masaya】
Of course not!
【Madoka】
Right. You better take good care of her.
【Masaya】
I <i>definitely</i> will.
【Madoka】
I'm sure you won't lose sight of your job as her coach, so this is honestly a huge weight off my shoulders.
【Madoka】
This might sound kind of cheesy, but make sure to take care of both Asuka-chan and your club responsibilities, got it?
【Masaya】
......
【Madoka】
Wh-Why are you just staring at me?
【Masaya】
I was just thinking we're lucky to have a manager as great as you.
【Madoka】
Heh... What, it took you this long to figure that out?
I was worried about how everything would turn out, but everything seems to proceed without any issues.
...Man, I can't thank Madoka enough.
【Asuka】
I see... Madoka-chan said that, huh?
I just finished telling Asuka about my conversation with Madoka.
【Asuka】
That makes me want to work even harder!
Asuka clenches her fists and strikes a pose.
【Asuka】
So, now that they all know, what should we do?
【Masaya】
We shouldn't force ourselves to act any different. We're together basically every single day, so we spend lots of time together already.
【Asuka】
G-Good point!
That's right. We're dating now, but not much else has really changed.
I just feel a little restless when we're alone together, that's all.
【Masaya】
(Where do we go from here...?)
Actually, when I start thinking about it, some inappropriate thoughts start to fill my head.
【Masaya】
(Th-There's no way I can tell Asuka about any of that!)
I shake my head to clear my mind.
We land at the terminal, then proceed to walk home.
【Masaya】
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
When we reach the fork in the road, I wave my hand at Asuka and begin to walk down my branch.
【Asuka】
Ah...
Asuka, however, just stands there without giving me any kind of response.
【Masaya】
Asuka?
Is something wrong? I'm <i>really</i> worried here...
【Asuka】
Oh, uh, um, it's nothing special...
She's fidgeting an awful lot...
【Asuka】
Um... I want to spend more time with you.
...Oh.
【Asuka】
Would that bother you?
【Masaya】
...No, I actually want the exact same thing.
【Asuka】
R-Really?! I'm so glad...
【Asuka】
Why don't you come to my place?
【Masaya】
Huh? Your place...?
【Asuka】
Yeah!
【Masaya】
Won't that bother your family...?
【Asuka】
Oh, no one's home today.
【Masaya】
I see. We'd be all alone...
【Asuka】
Yeah! That's part of the reason I want to spend more time with you.
Guess that explains her sudden invitation.
【Masaya】
(She didn't want to be alone, huh?)
I'm kinda disappointed to hear that's her main motive...
【Masaya】
(Wait, that doesn't change the fact that we're all alone!)
My heart's beating a mile a minute.
It's probably safe to say she likes me, so how is she taking all this?
【Masaya】
(...Well, duh, of course she likes you, Mr. Obvious.)
【Masaya】
(We already confessed to each other and everything. The hell am I thinking...)
Kinda feels like this whole situation has fried my brain...
【Asuka】
You can have this, Masaya-san.
Asuka hands me a cushion that looks like a strawberry.
【Masaya】
Oh, thanks.
I place it on the ground and sit on it.
【Asuka】
Phew...
Asuka sits down on her bed.
Then, we just look at each other and smile.
【Asuka】
I have to say, this feels kind of weird...
【Masaya】
Yeah, I know what you mean.
【Asuka】
I know we confessed to each other, and everyone else knows already, but it's still hard to believe we're actually dating...
【Masaya】
Yeah, it hasn't really sunk in yet.
【Asuka】
Um, Masaya-san, how do you feel about me...
【Masaya】
I love you. I really do.
【Asuka】
Whoa... That was amazing. You didn't even hesitate...
Asuka casts her gaze down to the floor as a blush stains her cheeks.
【Asuka】
I feel the same way... I love you, Masaya-san. But you know, that's also why I'm not sure what to do...
【Masaya】
What do you mean?
【Asuka】
Um, I've never dated anyone before, so I'm not sure how couples act.
【Asuka】
I-I know! Masaya-san, why don't you be my relationship coach, too?!
【Masaya】
H-Huuuh?!
What the hell is she saying...
【Asuka】
I was thinking maybe you could help me learn the ins and outs of being in a relationship...
【Asuka】
D-Does that sound too silly?
【Masaya】
Listen, Asuka.
【Asuka】
Yes!
【Masaya】
That's impossible. I can't coach you.
【Asuka】
You can't, huh? I see...
【Masaya】
I mean, I've never dated anyone either.
【Asuka】
Huh...? Whaaat?!
【Asuka】
No way, really?!
【Masaya】
...Yeah.
Why does it feel she just kicked me straight in the nuts?
Well, whatever. I can't really complain.
【Asuka】
I'm <i>really</i> surprised you've never had a girlfriend when you're so cool...
【Masaya】
Yeah, well, it's hard to believe you've never had a boyfriend when you're this cute...
【Asuka】
I-I swear I was nowhere even close to having one!
【Masaya】
O-Okay...
【Asuka】
And that's why I got all worried about you rejecting me after I realized I was in love with you...
【Masaya】
Yeah, I was in the same boat. I didn't manage to piece my feelings together until the moment you confessed...
【Asuka】
......
【Masaya】
......
【Asuka】
...Hehe.
【Masaya】
...Haha.
We start laughing.
Guess we're both surprised by how silly we acted before the confession.
【Asuka】
Ahaha... We're a couple of weirdos, aren't we?
【Masaya】
You can say that again.
Well, this is great. All that laughter has helped ease the tension in the air.
Plus, Asuka's expression has softened, too.
【Asuka】
Oh, I'm sorry. Give me a second.
Asuka's phone rings, at which point she checks the caller ID and promptly answers.
【Asuka】
Yep, I'm already home, Mom.
Oh, it's Kyoka-san.
Man, it's kinda nice to hear Asuka being more casual.
【Asuka】
Wait... what?! Oh, okay... I understand, yes...
【Masaya】
What'd she say?
【Asuka】
W-Well, um...
Asuka looks at me with a troubled, embarrassed expression on her face.
【Asuka】
My parents aren't going to make it home tonight.
【Masaya】
...Huh?
【Asuka】
It's just... us here...
I never expected this. Everything's changed...
It's gonna be hard for me to keep myself in check at this point...
【Asuka】
Masaya-san, can you, um... stay a little longer?
【Masaya】
Yeah, sure... I mean, I can't just leave you all alone.
【Asuka】
That's a relief. I'd feel pretty scared on my own...
Asuka flashes me a smile.
【Asuka】
Ah...! Um...
But then, she grips the hem of her skirt with both of her hands.
【Asuka】
...I've made up my mind.
Huh? About what?
【Asuka】
Masaya-san, please stand up.
【Masaya】
O-Okay... What now?
【Asuka】
Now sit down over here.
Asuka pats the spot next to her on her bed.
【Masaya】
...Okay.
I sit beside her.
This is my first time sitting on a girl's bed, so I'm real nervous...
Man, it's <i>really</i> soft... What the hell am I thinking?!
【Masaya】
Wh-What did you mean when you said you made up your mind, Asuka?
Asuka smiles at me despite my rather tense tone.
【Asuka】
Up until now, we've been sitting pretty far apart.
【Masaya】
Yeah, sounds about right.
【Asuka】
That's why I asked you to come closer. When you're as close as you are now, my heart beats faster...
Oh, I get it.
Yeah, this is probably the first time we've sat this close to each other.
Gotta say, it's a lot more embarrassing than the times we're flying side by side.
【Asuka】
I wasn't sure what to do, so I figured this was a good start... Was this a bad idea?
【Masaya】
No, it seems fine to me. Let's give it a shot.
【Asuka】
I'm glad! Thanks!
And so, we decide to bring the distance between us down a notch, but...
【Asuka】
......
【Masaya】
......
Man, I'm feeling more embarrassed than ever...
She's so close I find myself staring at her pretty eyes and supple lips.
【Asuka】
M-Maybe I made a mistake...
【Asuka】
This is <i>really</i> embarrassing...
Asuka's face looks like a tomato.
【Masaya】
A-Aren't you bored of just staring at my face?
【Asuka】
N-No! Not at all!
Asuka shakes her head vigorously.
【Asuka】
I've never taken a close look at the shape of your eyebrows or nose, so I can't stop...
...Guess we're on the same page here.
【Masaya】
Yeah, I've been looking at your eyes too. Oh, and also, your lips...
【Asuka】
M-My lips...?
【Masaya】
Yeah. They're tiny and cute...
【Asuka】
Th-Thank you! Yours are so rugged...!
【Masaya】
Thanks... Can't say I've heard that one before.
No one else can ever see us like this. We'd never live it down.
Never thought I'd be one of those annoying love birds people always talk about.
But you know what, I'm fine with that as long as I get to keep looking at Asuka's cute face.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san...
Asuka says my name in a hoarse voice.
And it flips a switch in me as it echoes around in my head.
【Masaya】
Um, Asuka...
【Asuka】
Yes...
My breath catches in my throat.
【Masaya】
I want to... kiss you...
Asuka's mouth opens and shuts a few times, but she just stares at me without saying a single word.
Come on, respond. I'm getting real nervous...
【Asuka】
...Okay.
Asuka closes her eyes after she says that.
【Masaya】
Asuka...
I bring my face closer to hers.
【Asuka】
Mmmph...
【Masaya】
Mmmph...
And eventually, my lips lightly touch Asuka's.
They feel soft and tender. Though, they're trembling a little.
【Asuka】
Mmmph... Mmm...
I wrap my arms around her body as I continue to kiss her.
【Asuka】
Oh, Masaya-san... Mmmph... Mmm...
Asuka tries to pull her mouth away, but I don't let her escape.
【Asuka】
Mmmph... Mmm... Mmmph...
This time, I press into her harder.
I kiss her lips over and over, enjoying the sensation.
【Asuka】
Haaah, Masaya-saaan... Mmmph... Mmm...
Asuka's feverish voice lights a fire within me.
And I can tell she's feeling a lot more hot than usual as well.
We lust after each other's lips to the point where we start getting sweaty.
【Masaya】
Asuka... you're so cute... Mmmph...
I can't even begin to express how I feel about her.
All I know is that I'm currently driven by the urge to make every single part of her mine.
【Asuka】
I... also... Mmm... Mmmph...
We don't stop kissing as we try to talk.
After all, our actions can convey our feelings just as well as words.
And so, we start kissing all sorts of different places...
【Asuka】
I really love your eyes.
Asuka gives me a peck near my eyes as she says that.
【Masaya】
And I... love this part of you here...
I lightly press my lips against one of her earlobes.
【Asuka】
Eek!
【Masaya】
Did that tickle?
【Asuka】
A little...
Asuka follows that answer up with a giggle.
【Asuka】
That's pretty naughty...
【Masaya】
Sorry, I just wanted to give it a try.
【Asuka】
I don't mind. In fact, it's making my heart beat a lot faster...
At that point, Asuka starts stroking my chest.
【Asuka】
I never imagined I'd be this close to you. Dating sure is amazing...
She mutters that in an intoxicated fashion.
【Masaya】
Yeah...
【Masaya】
...Hey. Oh, sorry. I'm spending the night at the clubroom.
【Masaya】
Huh? Of course I'm alone, don't be silly... I'm hanging up now.
【Asuka】
Li-ar!
Asuka actually seems to be mad about that little white lie.
【Masaya】
What, did you want me to say I was spending the night with a cute girl?
【Asuka】
You can't just throw out compliments like that... It makes it hard for me to argue with you...
【Masaya】
Well, yeah, that <i>was</i> my plan.
I start stroking Asuka's hair after I say that.
【Masaya】
Your hair's <i>really</i> pretty.
【Asuka】
You keep showering me with compliments...
【Masaya】
Only because you're so cute.
【Asuka】
G-Geez... Take this!
Asuka presses her body against mine.
【Asuka】
You're waaaaaay, <i>waaaaaaay</i> cooler than I am cute, okay?!
【Masaya】
Sure...
Asuka seems to love rubbing her head against my chest.
Man, that's kind of like how puppies show their affection, huh?
【Asuka】
Um, Masaya-san...
【Masaya】
Yeah?
Asuka looks at me with upturned eyes. Is she tired of rubbing up against me?
【Asuka】
I have a few requests.
【Masaya】
Really? Like what?
【Asuka】
The first one is about how I refer to you.
Huh? What does she mean?
【Asuka】
I call you Masaya-san, right?
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Asuka】
Can I go with Masaya-kun when we're alone...?
【Masaya】
Go right ahead... Why would you want to change it, though?
【Asuka】
I have this habit of being too polite when I meet a new person, which scares some people off.
【Asuka】
Now that we've started dating, I want to fix that part of me...
【Masaya】
Oh...
Asuka's pretty outgoing, so that's a surprise.
【Masaya】
Well, why don't we try to be more casual around each other, then?
【Asuka】
I-I need some more time for that...
【Masaya】
What's the big deal? Come on, just give it a try.
【Asuka】
But I don't want to...
She looks kinda worried about all this, but I can tell she's about to give in.
【Asuka】
Um, Masaya...kun... Um...
【Asuka】
L-Let's rock practice, 'kay...?
【Masaya】
...Pfft!
【Asuka】
Nooo! You laughed! You just laughed at me, didn't you?!
Asuka starts poking my chest. She's clearly upset.
【Masaya】
My bad. It just sounded <i>really</i> weird.
【Asuka】
Hmph...
Asuka puffs up her cheeks to express her dissatisfaction.
...You know, it's gonna be real hard to stop teasing her when her pouting is this cute.
【Masaya】
What's your other request?
【Asuka】
Oh, right. About the other request...
【Asuka】
I'll tell you after the fall tournament.
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Asuka】
It's related to FC, so that's a better time to ask...
It's got something to do with FC...? I wonder what she wants...
Nothing comes to mind, but I guess it has to be something she finds important.
【Masaya】
Okay, my turn. I've got a request of my own.
【Asuka】
You do? What is it...?
【Masaya】
Not now. We can talk more after the fall tournament.
【Asuka】
I don't want to wait that long. Just tell me now.
【Masaya】
You first. It's only fair, right?
【Asuka】
N-No! There's no way I can say it now!
【Masaya】
Well, why don't we just agree to tell each other at the same time?
【Asuka】
Huh?
【Masaya】
Once the fall tournament's over, and things have settled down, we can have a long talk about all this. That sound good?
【Asuka】
......
【Asuka】
...It does. It's a promise, then!
【Masaya】
Sure is!
【Asuka】
Okay, put out your pinky.
【Masaya】
Okay.
We make a pinky swear with smiles on our faces.
【Madoka】
Madoka Aoyagi's Club Diary.
【Madoka】
It's now September. Summer break is over, so we've entered a new school term.
【Madoka】
There are lots of changes within the school, but in our eyes, nothing is more important than winning the fall tournament.
【Madoka】
Naturally, we devoted most of our time to practice. However, this diary will be an account of other things that happened.
【Aoi】
I hope you guys didn't forget to study over your summer break.
【Aoi】
Make sure you're prepared so I don't have to hear you whine when midterms come around... That's all from me.
【Madoka】
Ms. Kagami delivered that devastating preemptive blow, which inspired fear within all of us.
【Misaki】
Udon, udon, udooon!
【Mashiro】
Misaki-senpai, Misaki-senpai, Misaki-senpaaai!
【Asuka】
I want to fly, I want to fly, I want to flyyy!
【Madoka】
Amidst all that, our three intrepid Skywalkers remained the same as ever.
【Misaki】
Man, practice is a lot harder when you're hungry!
【Mashiro】
Totally!
【Masaya】
Why are you having this conversation right next to my ear?
【Misaki】
Huh? Are we? Wow, what a coincidence!
【Mashiro】
Yeah, I didn't even notice!
【Masaya】
Enough! Come on, Shindou-san's done, so you're up next.
【Misaki】
Ugh, already? Gimme some udon! Boooooo!
【Mashiro】
Bring us some snacks, Senpaaai!
【Masaya】
Shut up already! Just get to work!
【Madoka】
Ms. Glutton and her underling are as irritating as ever.
【Madoka】
However, despite their complaints, they're tackling practice seriously.
【Satouin】
Rejoice! I have brought some refreshments!
【Madoka】
Oh, right. On one fine day, Satouin-san suddenly popped in and brought all sorts of food and drinks.
【Madoka】
I initially believed it was a show of compassion that was meant to please our gluttonous queen... but I was quickly proven wrong.
【Misaki】
Um, anchovies, fish paste, and... dried seaweed?
【Mashiro】
I have fish cakes, crab sticks, and fish fries...
【Satouin】
Feast your eyes upon the finest products produced by the Satou Seafood Corporation! You may eat to your heart's content!
【Madoka】
It basically ended up being an advertisement for her family's business. Though, it did make me wonder how many companies the Satou Group owned...
【Satouin】
Feel free to order more from our website once you run out. We also offer gift sets on Rakuten and... Is something wrong, Asuka Kurashina?
【Asuka】
Th-There's some flying fish stock...
【Satouin】
Oh my, do you have a problem with that?
【Asuka】
I-I can't really stomach it...
【Satouin】
How can you say that?! Flying fish stock is the lifeblood of Shitou's people! You won't ever grow healthy and strong without it!
【Asuka】
Nooo! You don't understand!
【Madoka】
As you can see, we faced some issues due to differences in culture and faith.
【Madoka】
However, at the end of the day, we knew Satouin-san just wanted to do something nice for us, so we really appreciated it.
【Shirase】
Today, we'll be doing some strength training to help build up your muscles.
【Shion】
Wait, did I hear muscles?! It's my time to shine!
【Madoka】
Unfortunately, my brother was beyond annoying on that day.
【Madoka】
So let's just leave it at that and move on.
【Madoka】
Oh, right. Speaking of annoying, a rather exasperating side of Hinata-kun came to light.
【Madoka】
There were no issues when it came to FC, but the same thing couldn't be said about his more personal matters.
【Masaya】
You did great out there, Asuka.
【Asuka】
Yes, thank you!
【Shindou】
You're winning more than 90% of the time now. I think it's safe to say we're in the final stage of practice.
【Shindou】
That said, Inui-kun is on a whole different level. I'm sure you already understand, but please keep that in mind, Kurashina-kun.
【Asuka】
Will do!
【Shindou】
She may even attempt some psychological attacks, so prepare yourself for that as well.
【Asuka】
U-Understood, but...
【Asuka】
I'll be fine as long as I have Masaya-kun with me!
【Masaya】
Whoa, Asuka, what are you saying?!
【Shindou】
Hm...?
【Misaki】
...I see. As long as you have "Masaya-kun" with you, huh?
【Asuka】
...What?
【Misaki】
Say, Asuka, when'd you start calling him "Masaya-kun"?
【Mashiro】
Oh, good point...
【Asuka】
Uh, uh, uhhh...
【Misaki】
Spill, Asuka!
【Asuka】
Huh? Oh, well...
【Masaya】
No, stop! You aren't telling them <i>anything!</i>
【Shindou】
...That's unfortunate. I'm rather curious as well.
【Shion】
I don't really get what's happening, but you shouldn't keep secrets from your fellow club members, Hinata!
【Misaki】
Aight, Shindou-san, team up with Prez and hold Masaya down!
【Shindou】
Roger.
【Shion】
Sure thing!
【Masaya】
What the hell?! Cut it out!
【Misaki】
So, Asuka, what's the story...? Say what?! Masaya's actually... Wow, very interesting...
【Mashiro】
Oh, so when you were alone, he... Whoa!
【Masaya】
Heeey! What are you telling them, Asuka?! Stop!
【Madoka】
I never imagined she would brazenly spill all those details.
【Madoka】
By the way, Misaki's suggestion that she just go with Masaya-kun was vehemently rejected, so nothing else changed. However, little old me kept teasing for a while after.
【Madoka】
Anyway, their relationship seemed to be going great. May they live happily never after.
【Madoka】
Putting that whole affair aside, Asuka soon reached a point where no one else could keep up with her.
【Masaya】
Go, Asuka!
【Asuka】
Understood, Masaya-san!
【Madoka】
Everyone always got serious as soon as practice began.
【Madoka】
And thanks to that, I had free time to write this diary. Otherwise, I would've had to spend more time whipping them into shape.
【Misaki】
Man, you're real fired up today, Asuka-chan.
【Mashiro】
What's out next attack, Misaki-senpai?!
【Shion】
Your speed's impressive, Kurashina! Maybe that means it's time for you to inherit my will!
【Shindou】
Very nice. I'm excited to see how much more you grow, Kurashina-kun... Watch carefully to prepare for next year, Ichinose-kun.
【Rika】
Gladly!
【Madoka】
And eventually, it was only one week out from the fall tournament.
【Madoka】
How will the fateful match between Asuka and Inui turn out?! And while we're at it, how will the relationship between Asuka and Hinata blossom?!
【Madoka】
Find out next time... in Madoka Aoyagi's diary!
【Misaki】
Aight, here we go...
【Misaki】
Phew... I'm beat.
【Masaya】
Sorry for making you help.
【Misaki】
No worries. The udon's a light at the end of the tunnel.
【Masaya】
...I don't remember promising you any udon.
【Misaki】
Let's just say the exchange went down on a subconscious level. We've got this whole connection going on.
【Masaya】
Yeah, no thanks. I'd rather not have some weird connection that'll drain my wallet.
Though, she has been a huge help, so one bowl of udon can't hurt...
【Misaki】
Man, this feels like something straight out of a manga.
Misaki's holding one of the weights she was wearing when she was flying as she says that.
【Masaya】
Yeah, I know what you mean. They're apparently pretty effective, though...
They're weights made specifically for FC training.
I asked Shirase-san to get me some to help Asuka.
【Misaki】
I can see that. Like, you'd <i>totally</i> go Super Saiyan if you took them off after getting used to flying around with them.
【Masaya】
Yep. Still, we gotta make sure Asuka doesn't hurt herself with them.
Getting used to flying with more weight on you is bound to help a normal person increase their normal speed, but in exchange, there's more stress on the body.
【Misaki】
True.
【Masaya】
Plus, I need to make sure this doesn't kill the fun she's having during practice...
【Misaki】
Hm...
【Masaya】
Why're you staring at me?
【Misaki】
You've kinda changed, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Huh...?
【Misaki】
You feel like a totally different person now, y'know? Like, you weren't the same before you got back into FC.
【Masaya】
You think?
【Misaki】
Back then, it didn't seem like you cared about anyone.
【Misaki】
But now you're doing so much for Asuka.
【Masaya】
Did I actually seem that bad?
Hm, I guess I wasn't very interested in the affairs of my fellow classmates.
Though, that doesn't mean I was focusing on myself or anything. Instead, I was just leading a depressing life where all I did was go through the motions.
There's no doubt in my mind that FC cured me of that illness.
【Misaki】
Guess you also have to thank Asuka.
【Masaya】
Yeah...
【Misaki】
I'm glad you started dating. You guys make a great couple.
【Masaya】
Don't start teasing me now...
【Misaki】
I'm not. I really mean it.
【Misaki】
I mean, you guys changed each other for the better.
【Masaya】
Oh, um... I guess that's true.
Like Aoi-san said, we didn't understand anything about each other outside of FC.
But now that we've gotten closer, we're starting to help fix any issues that are too much for either of us to deal with on our own.
【Masaya】
(Still...)
I'm a little surprised that Misaki noticed. And kinda happy, too.
That makes me think she also had her reasons for getting all worked up the last time Inui showed up at our school.
Maybe Misaki's a lot better at reading people than I thought.
【Misaki】
Honestly, there was a lot about Asuka that didn't sit well with me.
【Masaya】
Makes sense. You guys are like polar opposites.
【Misaki】
Yep. I probably would've ended up butting heads with her if Inui-san hadn't showed up after the summer tournament.
【Misaki】
Or just quit the club entirely before it came to that. Seems way more likely.
【Masaya】
I can picture that.
【Misaki】
She's just so different. Can't say I've ever met someone as straightforward as her.
Misaki narrows her eyes enviously after she says that.
【Misaki】
I'm pretty sure no matter how much I love something, I'll never be able to devote myself to it like her.
【Misaki】
No matter what, I always either get tired of stuff or give up when I hit a wall that's hard to climb over.
【Masaya】
I'm sure things would've gone well if you chose to put in some real effort.
【Misaki】
Huh...?
【Masaya】
You would've matured into a great player if you put your mind to it.
Misaki's eyes go wide as she processes my words.
【Misaki】
......
And eventually, she forms a gentle smile.
【Misaki】
...Thanks. It feels good to hear that.
【Masaya】
I'm not trying to flatter you. I <i>really</i> mean it.
【Misaki】
I know. You're no smooth operator.
【Masaya】
Well, sorry.
【Misaki】
Maybe I'll give it a shot after the fall tournament.
【Misaki】
I mean, it can't hurt, right?
【Masaya】
...I'm looking forward to that.
Misaki spins around, turning her back to me.
【Misaki】
Aight, Mashiro's gonna be here soon, so I'm out.
【Masaya】
Huh? You aren't gonna watch Asuka practice?
We aren't doing the three versus one practice today, but Misaki usually still sticks around.
【Misaki】
...Nah, I don't feel like it.
【Misaki】
Reflecting on the possible future I missed out on has me feeling a bit emotional.
【Masaya】
What the hell's that supposed to mean? It sounds like you're narrating a book.
【Misaki】
Hahaha, I know, right? Well, don't worry. I just need to cool my head.
【Misaki】
...Catch you later, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Y-Yeah...
Misaki dashes down the beach and leaves without uttering another word.
I guess some part of her still regrets how things turned out.
That's why she let me catch a glimpse of her inner turmoil, which she usually keeps locked away.
【Masaya】
(I can't help but wonder how it would've turned out...)
How different would things be if I chose Misaki over Asuka after the summer tournament?
They were relative equals when I made my decision, so it's hard to push that question out of my mind.
【Mashiro】
Hello. Huh? Wasn't Misaki-senpai here earlier?
【Masaya】
Oh, Mashiro. Misaki ran over that way.
I point across the beach, which makes a disappointed look surface on Mashiro's face.
【Mashiro】
No way. Does that mean I have to spend my time with you until everyone else shows up?
【Masaya】
Wow, that <i>really</i> hurts.
【Mashiro】
I'm just kidding. Though, I am disappointed that Misaki-senpai isn't here.
【Masaya】
It sure didn't sound like you were kidding...
【Mashiro】
Come on, don't sweat the small stuff. So, should we just wait here?
【Masaya】
Y-Yeah.
Mashiro sits down and starts gazing at the waves that are breaking at the beach.
Maybe she can't think of anything to discuss with me.
Still, this is pretty damn awkward, so I'd better break this silence...
【Masaya】
Hey, Mashi--
Yeah, I've gotta get her talking.
【Mashiro】
Say, Senpai.
Or... not, I guess?
【Masaya】
Yeah?
【Mashiro】
Be honest with me.
【Masaya】
About what?
【Mashiro】
I'm... pretty bad, aren't I?
【Masaya】
Where'd that come from?
【Mashiro】
Well, no matter how much I practice, I never see any signs of improvement.
【Mashiro】
I figure that must mean I have no talent, which makes me feel like a real loser...
【Mashiro】
Honestly, at this point, I just want to hear the truth.
No talent, huh?
Until recently, my lack of talent fueled my depression, giving me a reason to act like a total coward.
However, my opinion on the matter has changed thanks to Asuka.
【Masaya】
Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Yeah?
【Masaya】
The answer to your question is yes.
【Mashiro】
Haha... Right, of course.
【Masaya】
But I don't agree with that second part.
【Mashiro】
What second part? You mean when I said having no talent makes me a loser?
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Masaya】
How do you explain Asuka's growth if FC skill is based purely on talent?
【Mashiro】
Asuka-senpai?! But she's amazing! I'm nothing like her...
【Masaya】
Don't you remember what she was like when she first came to Kunahama?
【Mashiro】
I do... But doesn't that just show how her talent has helped her grow?
【Masaya】
No. Listen, Asuka <i>definitely</i> isn't some innately talented prodigy. If anything, that's Misaki.
【Mashiro】
But... that's...
Asuka's passion is the source of her rapid improvement.
【Masaya】
And yet, she still put in a ton of work without ever complaining.
【Masaya】
That's how she got so good.
【Mashiro】
...Are you saying I can get to her level if I work hard enough?
【Masaya】
Well, maybe not, but I'm sure you could get close.
【Mashiro】
......
【Masaya】
Anyway, point is, you shouldn't give up because of a lack of talent. Hell, I bet Asuka'd be pissed if she ever heard you say that.
Mashiro turns to the sea again.
There's no wind today, so the waves are slow and gentle.
【Mashiro】
If... and I only mean if...
【Mashiro】
If I had practiced even harder than Asuka-senpai and worked <i>really</i> hard...
【Mashiro】
Would you have, um... picked me?
【Masaya】
Of course.
【Mashiro】
Huh? Shouldn't you think about that a bit more?
【Masaya】
Look, I never once told you not to work hard, yeah?
【Mashiro】
Oh... You're right...
【Masaya】
If either you or Misaki had an actual goal in mind, I would've done my best to help you fulfill it.
It's not like I favored Asuka or anything.
She just earned her place by working harder than anyone else.
【Masaya】
I mean, that's my whole job as your coach.
【Mashiro】
I... see...
【Mashiro】
Then maybe I should've tried harder...
【Masaya】
What?
Mashiro doesn't repeat herself.
Instead, she just looks out at the shimmering sea.
That gorgeous, glowing sight that's produced once the sunlight is reflected by the water.
It's breathtaking.
【Asuka】
I'm done with the basic drills!
【Masaya】
Nice. Man, you sure took your time today.
【Asuka】
I did! Huh? Where's everyone else?
【Masaya】
Only Mashiro's here right now.
【Mashiro】
Asuka-senpai!
【Asuka】
Y-Yes, Mashiro-chan? What is it?
Mashiro suddenly latches onto Asuka's arm.
【Mashiro】
I'd love to get to know you better!
【Asuka】
O-Oh, sure...!
【Mashiro】
Great!
Man, Mashiro's <i>really</i> cute when she acts all sweet like this.
I'm sure Asuka's thinking the exact same thing, since her face is now dark red.
【Mashiro】
And also... tell me more about Masaya-senpai, okay?
【Asuka】
Huh...? Won't that make him angry?
Asuka timidly looks over to me.
【Masaya】
It <i>definitely</i> will.
【Asuka】
S-See! See!
【Mashiro】
What's the big deal?! God, you're such a killjoy, Masaya-senpai.
【Masaya】
Cut it out!
【Masaya】
Very nice. Your form's a lot more stable now.
【Rika】
Good!
【Masaya】
If you manage to maintain this form during vertical movement, your speed should go up considerably. Give it a try.
【Rika】
Understood!
Ichinose follows my instructions and soars through the dark sky.
Gotta say, this whole style of hers <i>really</i> suits her serious personality.
【Masaya】
Okay, let's stop here for today.
【Rika】
Roger!
We're done with practice, so we take a break in the sky.
【Rika】
Hinata-san.
Ichinose bows her head to me.
【Rika】
Thank you so much for helping me practice every single day.
【Masaya】
You're always helping Asuka, so this is the least I can do for you.
【Rika】
No, you've still done far too much for me. I will make some food and bring it over to help repay my debt.
【Rika】
Oh... Wait, would Asuka-san misunderstand?
【Masaya】
You don't have to worry about that.
【Rika】
Maybe you wouldn't mind, but I'm pretty sure Asuka-san would.
【Masaya】
You think?
【Rika】
Yeah. You need to be more careful, Hinata-san.
【Masaya】
Okay...
I'm a pretty carefree guy, but I guess that's gotta change now that I'm dating someone.
I've never even considered the possibility of doing anything like that with Ichinose, though...
【Rika】
I have to say...
Ichinose pauses and takes a deep breath. Hm, this must be something important...
【Rika】
I feel stupid for suspecting you at the start.
【Masaya】
Huh? When'd that happen?
【Rika】
Don't you remember the start of the training camp? I was rather rude to you, wasn't I?
...Oh, right.
Wow, it's only been half a year, but it feels like that happened a lifetime ago.
【Rika】
And yet, here I am now, trusting you more than anyone and having you help me with practice...
【Rika】
You just never know where life will lead you.
【Masaya】
Yeah... Totally.
I first ran into Asuka by accident, and even us joining the Kunahama FC Club came down to a chance meeting.
If just one thing happened in a slightly different way, nothing would be the same.
【Rika】
If you had gotten back into FC a little earlier...
【Rika】
You would have enrolled at Takafuji, right?
【Masaya】
Hm, yeah, maybe.
It's honestly hard to say, since Aoi-san's presence would've made Kunahama an appealing option.
Though, if I had returned to FC, she probably would've told me to go with the top FC school in the region.
So yeah, Ichinose's probably right.
【Rika】
Then... you would have been my upperclassman.
【Masaya】
True... and Satouin-san could've been my classmate.
She's pretty hard to handle, so how would that have gone?
Well, once you get to know her, it's obvious that she's actually considerate and kind, so I'm sure we would've gotten along just fine.
【Rika】
Hehe, right. It's a funny thought...
【Masaya】
Yeah, I bet it would've been pretty fun.
【Rika】
I'm sure Shindou-senpai and Satouin-senpai would've been completely different... And also, I...
Ichinose stops talking suddenly. Is something wrong?
【Masaya】
Ichinose?
【Rika】
I...
Something must be <i>really</i> wrong...
【Rika】
Okay... I'm going to change starting now.
【Masaya】
Uh, cool?
I guess what she was gonna say doesn't really matter.
It's fine as long as she's made up her mind.
【Rika】
Is it okay for me to do just one more lap?
【Masaya】
Yeah, go ahead.
【Rika】
Thanks!
Ichinose cheerfully takes off into the starry sky.
And this last bit of flight is totally different... In fact, I'd even say Ichinose's style has changed entirely.
It seems almost... mischievous now.
We're three days out from the fall tournament.
It's about time to put an end to this practice, so I address everyone that's gathered.
【Masaya】
You've all done great. Now, we just have to go out there in three days and beat Saki Inui.
Tomorrow, we're mainly going to discuss strategy, and the day after that has been set aside for rest and relaxation.
Obviously, that means this is our final proper practice session.
I can see them tense up as they realize what I'm getting at.
【Shindou】
So, what's on today's menu?
【Misaki】
Hm... It's our last day, so why don't we all gang up on Asuka?
【Asuka】
Eeep... Th-That sounds hard...
【Masaya】
No, I've got something else planned. Something that's probably <i>way</i> harder.
【Misaki】
Huh?
【Mashiro】
What?
【Asuka】
Really?
【Rika】
What could it possibly be?
【Shindou】
Please don't keep us in suspense, Hinata-kun.
【Masaya】
...Fine.
We move to the beach.
And once we get there, we spot a tall woman in a white coat.
【Aoi】
You guys are running kind of late.
【Misaki】
Huh...? Huuuuuuh?!
【Mashiro】
Wait, don't tell me she's Asuka-senpai's final sparring partner...?
【Rika】
I-I didn't expect that...
【Shindou】
Haha. True. She's definitely a much harder opponent than all of us combined.
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Aoi】
You're going to face me today, Kurashina. Prepare yourself.
【Asuka】
U-Understood...
Asuka's a nervous wreck.
Guess I'm not surprised...
【Madoka】
I've never seen Ms. Kagami play before...
【Shion】
Same... Actually, isn't that the case for everyone aside from Hinata?
【Shindou】
No, I've actually seen her play. It was a long time ago, though.
【Misaki】
Makes sense.
【Rika】
What kind of player was she?
【Shindou】
What do you mean?
【Mashiro】
Like, what was her playstyle... and what moves did she know? You know, stuff like that.
【Shindou】
Haha... That's a difficult question. Well, if I had to say...
【Misaki】
Yeah?
【Shindou】
She's strong.
【Misaki】
Huh?
【Shindou】
Don't misunderstand. I'm not fooling around. I just can't think of any other way to describe her.
【Shindou】
Aoi Kagami is an unparalleled Skywalker. That's the main impression I have in my mind.
【Shindou】
Speed, intuition, tactics, techniques... It goes without saying that she's mastered all those areas. Plus, her movements are quite efficient and beautiful.
【Misaki】
Wow, that means a lot coming from you...
【Shindou】
No one knows why she quit. It doesn't really make sense, since she was more than good enough to be a top Skywalker on the international circuit.
【Shindou】
Getting to watch her play is a rare blessing.
【Mashiro】
Wow, I didn't know she was that amazing...
【Shindou】
Hinata-kun must mean a lot to her if she's willing to do this for him.
【Madoka】
That makes sense. Hinata-kun was the one who asked her for help.
【Masaya】
Thank you, Ms. Kagami. I honestly didn't expect you to agree.
【Aoi】
You've finally returned to the sky, so I've got no excuse to keep moping around.
【Masaya】
Oh...
【Aoi】
Besides, I feel like this'll help you understand what you've been doing the last six months.
【Aoi】
...I can't wait.
There's a huge grin on her face.
And honestly, I haven't seen that smile in years.
My body trembles for a moment.
【Masaya】
(She isn't gonna hold back...)
I know I asked her to face Asuka, but I can't help but wonder if this is really a good idea...
Like, I'm sure Aoi-san isn't going to do anything that may hurt Asuka, but she's still <i>really</i> scaring me here.
【Shion】
Okay, everything's ready. The practice match will now begin.
Prez comes up from below.
【Shion】
We'll start as soon as both players confirm they're good to go.
Prez places the whistle in his mouth after he says that.
【Asuka】
I'm ready. You can start whenever.
【Aoi】
Same here. Let's get going.
Prez puffs up his cheeks...
And then...
【Aoi】
Let's see if you can keep up with me!
【Asuka】
Huh? What the...?!
What came first, the whistle or Aoi-san's movement?
She moves so fast that it's hard to even tell. Aoi-san's partway to second before Asuka even moves a muscle.
【Shindou】
Amazing!
【Misaki】
Wow... she's a lot faster than Inui-san!
【Rika】
I can't believe it...
Aoi-san looks like a streak of light as she rockets toward second.
I'm surprised too, but I can't waste more time.
【Masaya】
Asuka.
【Asuka】
Yes?!
【Masaya】
Don't panic. You'll play right into her hands if you do. Just jump to the second line and get ready to intercept her.
【Asuka】
Understood!
【Madoka】
Wow, Hinata-kun's real calm.
【Mashiro】
...He looks a lot more reliable than usual.
【Shindou】
I'm sure he understands.
【Rika】
Hm...?
【Shindou】
He must understand all of Ms. Kagami's strengths, as well as how to counter them.
【Misaki】
You mean... 'cause he's known her for so long?
【Shindou】
That's part of it, yes. However, he can't just rely on past memories.
【Shindou】
It's clear that his instructions are based on everything he's learned these last six months.
【Shindou】
Hinata-kun has also grown a lot.
【Misaki】
Oh, okay...
【Mashiro】
Yeah, he seems like a totally different person right now...
Aoi-san touches second.
That's 0:1.
Damn, that's impressive.
【Madoka】
No way! She's two seconds faster than Inui-san!
That may not seem like much, but every single millisecond counts in FC, so two seconds is a huge lead.
【Misaki】
Hold on, she isn't even wearing a flight suit...
【Mashiro】
Oh, good point. It should be hard to move in her clothes, but she seems just fine.
【Shindou】
I wonder how they'll react.
Asuka has reached the second line.
【Asuka】
I'm ready!
【Masaya】
Good. Now wait there. Once Ms. Kagami starts closing in, it's our turn.
【Asuka】
Understood!
Aoi-san appears before Asuka nearly instantly.
【Aoi】
What, you're trying to cage me up like Inui? You really think you're good enough to stop me?
【Asuka】
No, you're wrong... I'm...
I tell her it's time to pull out all the stops. And in response, Asuka gets moving.
【Asuka】
I'm going... for your back!
Asuka starts moving between five set points, which makes it impossible to guess her angle of attack.
A pentagram of her afterimages forms around Aoi-san as she darts between them at top speed.
【Aoi】
This is...
Aoi-san sounds <i>really</i> surprised.
【Shindou】
It's almost perfect. Kurashina-kun really has improved a lot.
【Rika】
Yeah...!
Asuka's technique receives high praise from Shindou-san and Rika, who've been helping her develop it.
【Aoi】
I knew you'd been practicing polygon attack chains, but I didn't think you'd mastered it yet.
【Aoi】
Feels like I'm playing against an international pro...
Her tone of voice is calm, but I can tell she's nervous.
【Masaya】
Okay, strike while the iron's hot!
【Asuka】
Understood, here I go!
Asuka launches her attack from the vertex that's hardest to spot.
She uses the force of her turn to boost her speed as she Airkick Turns toward Aoi-san.
【Aoi】
Hmph, how predictable!
Unfortunately, Aoi-san seems to have guessed where the attack was coming from.
She nimbly evades Asuka's attack with the grace of a butterfly.
【Masaya】
This is your chance! Now!
【Asuka】
Yes!
【Aoi】
What?!
Asuka instantly Airkick Turns to reverse her course.
And thanks to that, she manages to touch Aoi-san's wide open back.
【Aoi】
Ugh, not bad...!
Wow, even Aoi-san's praising her... Nice.
They're even at 1:1.
【Misaki】
Sweet!
【Mashiro】
Amazing!
【Shindou】
No, that's not good enough. She needs to score another point before it's too late.
Shindou-san's right.
We're even now, so we need another point to win. However, Aoi-san's going to be a lot more careful from this point on.
That's why we need to score again right away. Otherwise, we're in trouble.
【Masaya】
Go for another one, Asuka!
【Asuka】
Gladly!
There's a gap between them because of the repulsion from when she touched Aoi-san.
And Aoi-san uses that to escape upward in an attempt to claim the high ground.
【Masaya】
(Her back's wide open again...)
This is it!
【Aoi】
Masaya.
【Masaya】
Yeah... Huh, what, Ms. Kagami?
Why's she talking to me right now?
【Aoi】
How many times did I tell you that an obvious chance is most likely a trap?
Her words make my hair stand on end.
【Masaya】
This is bad, Asuka! Stop and reverse!
【Asuka】
Huh?!
Dammit, my warning's too late...
【Aoi】
Got you, Kurashina!
Aoi-san spins around on the spot.
【Asuka】
Eeek!
That gets her out of harm's way... and allows her to reach Asuka's back.
Great, now it's 1:2 in Aoi-san's favor.
【Misaki】
Ugh, seriously?! Why'd that happen right after she scored a point?
【Madoka】
Wh-What did Ms. Kagami just do...?
【Mashiro】
Um, yeah, good question...
Everyone's confused by what just happened.
Makes sense. Aoi-san was <i>really</i> fast, so it was hard to even notice.
【Aoi】
What's wrong, Masaya? Why'd you fall for such a simple feint?
Yeah, I messed up. If I'd guessed what she was gonna do, Asuka could've avoided her attack.
But honestly, how was I supposed to know she was gonna pull that out in a practice match?
It seems like she's taking this really, <i>really</i> seriously. This'll be tough.
【Masaya】
Are you really gonna go all out?
【Aoi】
Of course. I'm sure Kurashina wouldn't want it any other way.
【Masaya】
...Fine. Guess I'll get serious, too.
【Aoi】
Glad to hear it. Make sure you focus, Kurashina.
【Asuka】
Y-Yes! I'll return the favor soon enough!
【Aoi】
That's the spirit... Yeah, this is the only way to practice for a <i>real</i> match.
【Aoi】
I'll warn you, though, I'm no pushover!
Aoi-san spreads her arms wide as she says that.
【Masaya】
I haven't felt this way in ages...
Aoi Kagami was once a professional Skywalker who was known throughout Japan.
And here she is again, right before my eyes, just as strong and skilled as ever.
【Masaya】
I wanna beat her...
Those are my honest feelings.
However, that's not where our road ends.
Asuka and I will beat her and travel beyond the sights she's seen.
【Misaki】
Haaah... Man, even watching this match is exhausting.
【Madoka】
Yeah, I can't really follow what's going on.
【Mashiro】
She was already <i>really</i> good, so I don't see how they can compete now that she's gotten serious...
【Rika】
Wh-What do you think, Shindou-senpai...?
【Shindou】
Fantastic...
【Rika】
Huh?
【Shindou】
She really is a god.
【Rika】
A god?
【Shindou】
Kunahama has birthed two legends in the FC world: Aoi Kagami and Hayato Shirase. I was convinced I'd never see them play the sport again, yet here I am now, able to witness one of those gods play only months before I graduate...
【Shindou】
...I was thinking of quitting, but I may have to rethink that option.
【Rika】
Huh? What do you mean?!
【Shindou】
Exactly what I said. I wanted to quit FC.
【Rika】
Wh-What...?! B-But why?!
【Shindou】
I once reached the very top of amateur FC, but on the inside, I was a mess of emotions. That's why I planned on turning down all the offers I received.
【Shindou】
However, I've changed my mind. Ms. Kagami is calling out to me, telling me to come up and meet her. That's why I...
【Rika】
You what?
【Shindou】
I'm going to join the international circuit.
【Rika】
Ah...!
【Shindou】
Right now, she's trying to tell them that there are things you can't see until you climb onto that stage.
The match is raging on.
Half the time has run out by now, and they've both completed a full lap around the field, which has added to the point total.
However, we haven't managed to pull ahead of her at all. Aoi-san's been in the driver's seat this whole time.
【Asuka】
Oh no... I-I need to somehow get to the buoy ahead of her!
They're sitting at 3:4.
Aoi-san beat Asuka to the punch on the second line, which got her the fourth point, so our only choice is to go for second.
【Aoi】
Haha! Come on, you're nowhere near as fast as me, Kurashina!
Aoi-san chases after her, shooting straight toward second.
【Asuka】
That's not true!
Asuka refuses to lose as she takes the shortest possible route to the buoy, but even so, the gap between them is closing.
【Aoi】
You sure about that?
【Asuka】
Ugh...
Asuka's clearly frustrated.
【Misaki】
She's making Asuka rely on speed, which is her weak point... Man, Ms. Kagami's a <i>total</i> sadist.
【Rika】
Forcing your opponents into situations where you have the advantage is a standard tactic.
【Misaki】
Yeah... Well, I bet Masaya's got some kinda plan brewing...
【Mashiro】
But they aren't doing anything special...
【Shindou】
I'm sure they'll try something once they get near second.
Aoi-san's flying on the same horizontal plane as the buoy.
Asuka, on the other hand, is flying a slightly wavy line, so she's definitely at a disadvantage.
【Masaya】
Asuka, can you move upward?
【Asuka】
Y-Yes! But if I do, she'll <i>definitely</i> catch up!
【Masaya】
That's fine. Fly up slowly so she doesn't notice.
【Asuka】
Understood...!
Asuka adjusts her trajectory slightly like I instructed.
The vertical distance between them is gradually increasing...
【Aoi】
What's wrong? Have you given up and decided to go for my back?
Aoi-san starts taunting us as she continues on her way toward second.
And before long, she passes Asuka and takes the lead.
【Misaki】
Damn it, she passed Asuka!
【Mashiro】
God, what is he thinking? Why'd he make her move up when they aren't in a dogfight...
【Shindou】
...I understand.
【Rika】
Have you figured out Hinata-san's plan, Shindou-senpai?
【Shindou】
Probably. He...
Shindou-san knows, huh?
【Aoi】
...Oh.
Aoi-san sounds impressed. Guess she's figured it out as well.
【Asuka】
Here I go!
Asuka rushes down toward the buoy from above.
【Aoi】
I see. You realized she had no chance of beating me in a straight race to the buoy, so you decided to rely on gravity.
【Aoi】
Using a Low Yo-Yo variant would bring us to the same plane, and her speed would even end up exceeding mine.
【Aoi】
You made the right call, Masaya.
And that's 4:4. We've finally caught up again.
【Misaki】
Aight!
【Mashiro】
Nice!
【Madoka】
Now they're even again!
【Shindou】
......
【Shindou】
...Strange.
【Rika】
What's wrong?
【Shindou】
Well, based on what Ms. Kagami just said, their actions were well within her expectations.
【Misaki】
Hm, yeah, you've got a point.
【Madoka】
Right, there's nothing all that unique about their plan.
【Shindou】
There's no doubt that Ms. Kagami's taking this match seriously.
【Shindou】
However, every once in a while, it seems like she's sending a message.
【Mashiro】
A message...?
【Shindou】
Yes. They're probably meant for Hinata-kun.
Something strange has been happening for a while now.
We've been engaging in a serious battle with Aoi-san this whole time.
I can't even afford to lose focus for a moment, so I'm in a constant state of high-alert, which should be wearing me out.
And yet...
【Masaya】
(Why does this...)
【Masaya】
(Why does this feel so nostalgic...?)
Somehow, this whole thing seems awfully familiar.
【Masaya】
(I'm sure this isn't just my imagination. Think, Masaya...)
She started the match with a speed race.
Then, she pulled out a feint in a dogfight.
And after that, she combined quick horizontal movements with clever flight path selection and the force of gravity to advance toward the next buoy.
【Masaya】
Ah...
My jaw drops.
【Masaya】
Ms. Kagami, don't tell me...
It can't be...
【Aoi】
I'm glad you finally noticed, Masaya.
Aoi-san's voice sounds pretty damn gentle as she says that.
【Masaya】
I'm just sorry it took this long.
【Aoi】
Geez... Back in the day, I'd have punished you for that.
【Asuka】
Um, what are you two talking about...?
Asuka's confused by our exchange.
【Masaya】
She's been replicating them the whole time.
【Asuka】
Replicating what, exactly?
【Masaya】
The things she and I practiced together.
【Asuka】
Huh...?
That's right. She's just been pulling off things we used to go over this whole time.
In order to teach me how to fly fast, she corrected my form endlessly.
In order to teach how to come out on top in a dogfight, she taught me how to slip out of an opponent's reach.
She also taught me how to detect and counter feints, then get away.
And finally, she taught me how to reach a buoy with the help of gravity...
I've gone through all of this in the past.
I've witnessed all these techniques that the champion, Aoi Kagami, has mastered many times.
After all, she once taught me each and every one of them.
【Masaya】
She's been training us this whole time...
【Asuka】
I... see...
【Aoi】
But I'm putting an end to that right now...
Aoi-san's voice sounds somewhat sad as she says that.
【Aoi】
Masaya, do you remember that move I showed you just once...?
【Masaya】
What do you...?
Before I finish my question, I realize what she means.
【Masaya】
Wait, you're not gonna use it on Asuka, are you?!
【Aoi】
The match is about to end, so don't you think it's a good way to cap things off?
Uh, no, that's actually probably a bit too much for Asuka to handle...
But I guess in your eyes, that's a necessary step that'll help her grow.
【Asuka】
Wh-What are you talking about, Masaya-san?!
【Masaya】
Watch her carefully.
【Aoi】
Eat this!
Aoi-san disappears after she yells that.
【Asuka】
Huh?! Wh-Where'd she go?!
【Masaya】
Around you, Asuka.
【Asuka】
Around...? Wh-What?!
Asuka moves her head left and right in attempt to find her.
However, Aoi's circling Asuka at a constant high speed, which makes it hard to follow her.
The bright contrails engulf Asuka, coloring her surroundings, and quickly take the form of a perfect circle that's reminiscent of a halo.
【Masaya】
Angelic Halo... That's what they named the move at the World Championship.
It's a special move that cuts off any hope of escape.
Its beauty belies its danger, which is why it earned that almost ironic name.
【Misaki】
Guys, I'm <i>totally</i> lost...
【Mashiro】
Um, Ms. Kagami's flying around that white shine, right...?
【Madoka】
I guess so, yeah.
【Shindou】
Amazing. I didn't expect to see this move...
【Rika】
Have you seen it before?
【Shindou】
Of course not. Honestly, it's little more than a legend at this point.
【Shindou】
All I know is that it's a move Aoi Kagami used at the World Championship before locking it away.
【Misaki】
Huh, she stopped using it?
【Mashiro】
Why?
【Shindou】
I suppose because it's taboo.
【Shindou】
The Angelic Halo consumes a huge amount of stamina, so it can only be used at the end of a match.
【Shindou】
However, since you're robbing your opponent of all movement, it was rather controversial.
【Misaki】
Isn't it kinda like Inui-san's Bird Cage?
【Shindou】
It's not as good at controlling your opponent, but it can also create a similar no-win scenario.
【Shindou】
Do you remember what you did to Ichinose-kun during the summer tournament?
【Misaki】
Yeah.
【Rika】
I remember.
【Shindou】
In that match, you circled around Ichinose-kun to keep her from moving until time ran out.
【Misaki】
Mhm.
【Shindou】
Well, the Angelic Halo is the exact same thing, but on a much higher level.
【Rika】
...So you mean it forces your opponent into a situation where they can't attack?
【Shindou】
Exactly. If Kurashina-kun tries to escape, Ms. Kagami, who is moving at an incredibly high speed, will <i>definitely</i> catch her.
【Mashiro】
You're saying it's impossible...?
【Shindou】
If she doesn't nail the timing, Ms. Kagami will land more than one hit.
【Rika】
But the shoes she's using are an old model from the Hien series, right?
【Shindou】
Kouens, yes. They may be an old model, but they used to be high-end back in the day. Even now, there are many players who love them.
【Rika】
If I remember correctly, Hien are All-Rounders, though...
【Misaki】
Huh? That makes no sense! I mean, moving that fast without Fighter shoes... Actually, <i>even with</i> Fighter shoes, that's insane!
【Shindou】
She's relying on the same principle as the Airkick Turn and the Cobra.
【Mashiro】
How?
【Shindou】
I'm sure you know how the Airkick Turn works. You curl your body, bringing your arms and legs inward, to bypass the membrane shifting time. This allows you to pull off a quick, high-speed turn.
【Shindou】
The Angelic Halo uses the same principle of instantaneously shifting the membrane in the direction of motion. You line your arms parallel to your body, then touch yourself repeatedly at just the right moments.
【Shindou】
That makes rapid acceleration possible.
【Misaki】
I kinda get how it works now, but if it's that good, why don't more people use it?
【Shindou】
Can you chain 100 consecutive Airkick Turns?
【Misaki】
O-Of course not. That's crazy!
【Shindou】
Well, that's why. And on top of that, applying force toward the direction of motion is considerably more difficult than applying it in the opposite direction.
【Shindou】
I don't want to sound conceited, but there are very few players out there who can use the Cobra. It requires you to stop abruptly, then accelerate quickly in the direction of motion.
【Rika】
So you're trying to say that, while both moves are exceedingly difficult to pull off, nailing the timing for the Cobra's membrane shift is still a lot easier than the Angelic Halo's?
【Shindou】
Yes.
【Shindou】
You have to isolate the accelerative parts of the membrane to perform the consecutive momentum boosts, and that's no easy task. Even I can only manage two seconds.
【Misaki】
Wow, someone like you can only do two seconds...
【Shindou】
Two seconds is far too short for that move to be effective, so I can't use it.
【Shindou】
Keeping it up for close to two minutes like Ms. Kagami is impossible for any normal person...
【Shindou】
That being said... the move has one fatal flaw.
【Mashiro】
So if they take advantage of that, then--?
【Shindou】
Well, the thing is, it's not a flaw you can necessarily "take advantage" of. See, when you accelerate in that way, the membrane goes off balance, meaning you can't fly straight forward.
【Misaki】
I see...
【Shindou】
Continuously shifting the membrane around while moving at high speeds naturally forces you into a ring trajectory.
【Shindou】
Normally, such a technique would be useless, since you can't use it to move forward... However, what makes Ms. Kagami so amazing is that she managed to find a unique use for it.
【Masaya】
She's challenging us to break through that, huh?
She only ever showed me it as a cautionary tale, to warn me off from trying anything like it.
The fact that she's actually using it now means she <i>really</i> wants to win.
Question is, how are we supposed to beat an invincible move?
【Asuka】
Masaya-san...
Asuka sounds worried.
【Asuka】
This is just like Inui-san's Bird Cage. There are no openings...
【Asuka】
She'll <i>definitely</i> get me no matter where I go!
If Asuka carelessly tries to break through, Aoi-san'll score. And if she tries to fly up, Aoi-san will just use her high speed to touch her back.
There's no escape route.
However, if we do nothing, she'll just wait until the last second, then rush toward second to win.
I know that's her plan.
【Masaya】
Think, Masaya. There has to be an answer...
Turn to the sky, and don't avert your eyes...
I try to recall what Aoi-san said when she showed it to me.
Remember. I have to remember...
【Aoi】
Listen, Masaya, this move is "taboo."
【Masaya】
Why...?
【Aoi】
Because the person using it will feel guilty. They'll feel like they're doing something unfair to pull out a win.
【Aoi】
And that's your opening. Set your sights on your opponent and strike. Charge straight ahead.
【Masaya】
That's my opening...
【Aoi】
That's right. Shady tactics have no place in the world of FC, so a person who uses the Angelic Halo will never reach the top. You just need to believe in that and win.
【Masaya】
...Gotcha!
【Masaya】
Right. I remember now.
She actually did teach me how to beat this move.
【Masaya】
Asuka.
【Asuka】
Yes!
【Masaya】
Fly straight ahead as soon as I give you the signal. Don't hesitate, okay?
【Asuka】
Don't... hesitate?
【Masaya】
That's right. If you have any second thoughts, you won't make it out of the ring.
【Masaya】
I'll tell you when to go for her back, so just believe in me and shoot straight ahead.
【Asuka】
I see... That means I have nothing to worry about.
【Asuka】
My faith in you has been my strongest weapon this whole time!
【Masaya】
Yeah... I feel the exact same way about you.
【Asuka】
I know...!
I strain my eyes in order to carefully watch Aoi-san's movements.
At a glance, there don't seem to be any gaps Asuka can slip through.
However, there's always a chance as long as a Skywalker and their second trust each other to make the right call.
The true enemy here is fear.
【Masaya】
There's no way... I'll mess this up!
I work out the optimal time by measuring her speed.
【Shion】
There's one minute left!
We've got no time. This is our last chance to win this match.
I'll tell Asuka to go when Aoi-san's on her seven.
That should work!
【Masaya】
Three, two, one...
【Masaya】
Now!
【Asuka】
Understood!
The moment I give her that signal, Asuka's body catapults forward.
A flash of red light is now visible within the ring.
【Shindou】
She's moving!
【Rika】
Please make it!
The two lights clash as everyone looks on in anticipation.
And...
The ring gets torn apart. Our trust triumphs.
【Shion】
The match is over! Asuka Kurashina wins with a score of 5:4!
【Misaki】
She did it! Asuka won!
【Mashiro】
Amazing...!
【Madoka】
I can't believe she managed to get out of that ring...! You're <i>so</i> cool, Asuka-chan!
Cheers erupt from all around us, but...
【Asuka】
......
【Asuka】
H-Huh...? I won?
...Asuka still can't process what just happened. She's just floating there with a confused look on her face.
【Masaya】
Just land first, Asuka.
【Asuka】
O-Oh, okay...!
Asuka listens to me and flies down.
And when she does, she spots Aoi-san, who's been waiting for her on the ground this whole time.
【Aoi】
Kurashina.
【Asuka】
Y-Yes, Ms. Kagami?
【Aoi】
You won. Congrats.
Aoi-san walks up to Asuka and gives her a pat on her shoulders.
【Asuka】
Wait, so I actually broke through that ring?!
【Masaya】
That's right, Asuka. You did it.
【Asuka】
No, you're wrong, Masaya-san.
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Asuka】
<i>We</i> did it.
【Masaya】
...Yeah, we did.
【Aoi】
Exactly. Remember, the trust between a Skywalker and their second is the ultimate weapon. As long as you have that, you can defeat Saki Inui.
【Asuka】
Ms. Kagami...
【Aoi】
Congrats. You've cleared the first stage with that, Kurashina.
【Asuka】
Y-Yes, thank you...! Eek!
【Misaki】
Asukaaa! You totally killed it!
【Mashiro】
Asuka-senpai, that was crazy! You actually beat Ms. Kagami!
【Madoka】
I'm so happy for you! All your hard work's paid off!
Madoka's right.
It seems like everything's gonna be okay at this point.
【Shindou】
...You've cleared your first major hurdle, Hinata-kun.
【Rika】
That was a fantastic match!
【Masaya】
Thanks. Seems like we managed to pull out a win somehow.
【Shindou】
Don't be so humble. You were amazing. In fact, I want to thank you for that display.
【Masaya】
Shindou-san...
【Shindou】
You've earned the right to be confident. Saki Inui is a tough opponent, but I'm certain you two are more than up to that challenge.
【Masaya】
Thank you.
【Rika】
Make sure you give Asuka-san all the praise she deserves.
【Masaya】
Sure thing.
But before that...
There is someone I have to meet.
【Masaya】
Ms. Kagami.
Aoi-san's standing on the beach in her usual confident pose, gazing out at the sea.
And when she hears me call out to her, she turns toward me and smiles.
【Aoi】
Masaya.
She says my name all the time.
However, I haven't felt this emotional about it since back when I was still a kid.
【Masaya】
Thanks for the match, Ms. Kagami.
【Aoi】
I'm just glad you remember my lessons.
【Masaya】
Yeah, though I did get some things wrong at the start. Sorry about that.
【Aoi】
It's fine. Just think of it as an experience that'll make you stronger. Use it to help you come out on top at the fall tournament, okay?
【Masaya】
I promise I will.
And I'm <i>definitely</i> gonna keep my word.
【Aoi】
I really need to thank you.
【Masaya】
What? No, I need to thank you.
Aoi-san shakes her head as she hears my reply.
【Aoi】
No, Masaya, you're wrong. You've freed me from the worry that's been haunting me for years.
【Masaya】
What worry?
【Aoi】
I'll tell you eventually. It's a <i>really</i> long story.
【Aoi】
Anyway, you did a great job. You're an amazing coach, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Thanks... But we won't know if that's true until after the fall tournament.
【Aoi】
True. You still have to get over the main hurdle in three days. However, that last practice match is a good sign.
【Masaya】
Right. I know Asuka's gonna win. We'll break through that Bird Cage just like how we broke through your Angelic Halo.
【Aoi】
......
【Aoi】
...Yeah, a style like that shouldn't exist. I really want you to succeed to keep people from suffering through the same things I once did.
【Masaya】
Ms. Kagami...?
【Aoi】
Well, congrats. Now, go celebrate with your partner. That's another thing every second needs to do.
【Masaya】
O-Of course!
【Aoi】
...Masaya.
【Aoi】
...Thanks.
Like that, a very eventful day passed by.
The next day, we went over our strategies one last time.
And now, it's the final day before the tournament.
【Masaya】
Ugh...
Light shines in through the window and hits my face, forcing me to open my eyes.
【Masaya】
Damn, it's still only eight...
I rise up to check the time, then slump back into bed.
I've been under a lot of stress lately, so I'm beat. A little more sleep can't hurt...
【Masaya】
I'll just catch a few more Zs... Good night.
...
......
.........
【Masaya】
Man, who the hell is that...?
【Masaya】
Huh?!
The name on the caller ID makes me snap awake.
【Masaya】
H-Hello?
【Asuka】
Oh, sorry, were you asleep...?
【Masaya】
N-No, of course not. I got up a while back.
【Masaya】
Why are you here when there's no practice scheduled?
【Asuka】
Oh, well, since today's a day off, um...
【Asuka】
...I wanted to see you. I'm sorry if I interrupted anything...
【Masaya】
......
【Asuka】
Um, Masaya-kun, is something wrong?
【Masaya】
No, uh, it's just...
【Asuka】
Just what...?
【Masaya】
I'm having a hard time thinking of what to say, since you're making my heart race...
【Masaya】
S-Sorry. I kept you waiting, huh?
【Asuka】
N-No, not at all!
But it's been 30 minutes...
【Masaya】
So, what are we gonna do?
【Asuka】
Nothing special. It shouldn't take long.
【Masaya】
Huh? Really?
【Asuka】
I just want to talk...
【Asuka】
I figure taking up more of your time is a bad idea, since we have the tournament tomorrow and all...
Honestly, I'm not sure what to do. I mean, as her coach, I should probably be telling her to rest.
I'm sure everyone else would agree, and even Asuka would understand.
But I'm not just her coach...
【Masaya】
U-Um, listen...
【Asuka】
Yes!
My girlfriend's saying she wants to spend more time with me, so...
...I can't just let her talk a little and head back home.
【Masaya】
Why don't we go somewhere?
【Asuka】
Huh...? A-Are you sure that's okay?
【Masaya】
Yeah. We've got no practice scheduled or anything, so nothing's stopping us. Plus...
【Asuka】
Hm?
【Masaya】
...I haven't really taken you out on a date or anything yet.
【Asuka】
Ah...
【Masaya】
S-So, yeah...
Here we are, staring into each other's eyes first thing on a Saturday morning.
Our faces look like tomatoes, and honestly, we'd probably have heart attacks if anyone saw us like this.
【Asuka】
I can't even remember the last time I rode a bus.
【Masaya】
Yeah. Don't really have much use for them when we have Grav Shoes.
We used the bus to head into town.
That only happened because I figured it was best to not use Grav Shoes the day before the tournament.
People our age only ride the bus on rainy days, so this is pretty weird.
【Masaya】
Didn't know the buses only ran in the mornings and evenings.
【Asuka】
That makes sense. I mean, you just said people don't really use them around here, right?
Yeah. Case in point, the only other passengers were some older people and a mother with her child.
We stuck out like sore thumbs.
【Masaya】
That means we have until they start running again in the evening. Let's have a good time!
【Asuka】
Sounds good! So, where are we going?
【Masaya】
......
【Asuka】
......
【Masaya】
...C-Can you give me a moment?
【Asuka】
Uh, why?
I turn my back to Asuka to keep her from noticing the look of panic on my face.
【Masaya】
(I haven't thought of anything...!)
I don't usually hang out with friends, and whenever I want to go shopping, I just head to Iron Mall. Damn, my loner lifestyle's backfiring right now.
Where do people even go on dates?
There's gotta be something... Anything...
【Masaya】
U-Um, yeah...
I turn back to Asuka.
【Masaya】
You wanted to get a parfait at that cafe we went to before, right? Why not start there?
Phew... I managed to think up a pretty great idea.
【Asuka】
Wow, I get to try that parfait again...! N-No, we can't!
Asuka's eyes light up for a moment, but she quickly shakes her head and rejects my suggestion.
【Asuka】
I love the idea, but, um, I think we should save that for after the tournament.
【Masaya】
G-Good point...
She's right.
There's no point rewarding yourself before you go to face a challenge.
Well, maybe it'd make sense if it was some kickoff party or something, but still...
【Asuka】
I'm really, <i>really</i> sorry about turning down your invitation... Uh...
【Masaya】
D-Don't be. It's my fault for not thinking things through!
I should've known.
Hm... But where does that leave us?
Heading to Fukuru Island on the ferry... will take too long. Strolling around the island... is basically the same as hiking, so it'll wear us out.
【Masaya】
(H-Holy shit, there's nothing to do on this island!)
We <i>could</i> always hit up Mashiro Udon, but I feel like that'd be pretty dangerous...
【Mashiro】
Welcome... Oh, it's you.
【Mashiro】
Masaya-senpai... Don't tell me you gave us the day off so you could fool around with Asuka-senpai...
【Mashiro】
Oh, don't get me wrong, that's fine by me. Say, why not order our couple's bowl? It only comes with one pair of chopsticks...
【Mashiro】
Hehehe...
【Masaya】
Yeah, that's out of the question!
【Asuka】
What...?
It's not worth the risk.
Unfortunately, that means I'm out of options.
Think Masaya... There has to be something!
【Asuka】
Almost... Almost...!
【Asuka】
Yay! I did it, Masaya-kun!
【Masaya】
N-Nice, Asuka!
【Asuka】
There's one more I want, so I'll try to get it as well!
Asuka turns to face the crane game again.
She's pretty excited about all this, but honestly, I feel depressed.
【Masaya】
Can't believe I couldn't think of anywhere else...
Asking Asuka out on a date was a stroke of genius, but everything else has been the work of an idiot.
I mean, there's nothing wrong with the idea of not using Grav Shoes for a day, but I should've planned stuff out better before suggesting that.
In the end, the only place close to us is this arcade, and we've already been here before...
【Masaya】
Man, I need to step up my non-FC knowledge...
Maybe one of Ms. Madoka's patented lessons will help.
【Asuka】
Yaaay! I managed to get another one!
【Masaya】
O-Oh, sweet!
The only saving grace is that Asuka's enjoying herself.
【Asuka】
We're finally here.
【Masaya】
Yeah. Gotta say, it feels completely different when you walk up to it on a sunny day.
【Asuka】
I only walk to school on rainy days, so this is a nice change of pace.
【Masaya】
Grav Shoes have changed our lives a bunch, so there's a lot we take for granted.
We strolled around aimlessly for a while after leaving the arcade.
Eventually, we spotted the school, at which point Asuka suggested that we drop by.
It seems Asuka's not used to this sight because she's been using Grav Shoes every day since she first moved here.
However, I had a period of time where I avoided flying, so this isn't my first time walking to school on a sunny day.
【Asuka】
It's also kind of nice to be at school this late in our casual clothes.
【Masaya】
True. We're usually practicing in our flight suits around this time.
We're the only members of our club that are around right now.
It's kinda nice to be here all alone...
【Asuka】
Come to think of it...
Asuka looks to the right of the old school building.
【Asuka】
Have you ever been in there?
【Masaya】
Oh, that place...
She's talking about a small, old chapel that's next to the old school building. It's been around since the school was first built.
Kunahama Academy used to be a mission school, but things are different now, so no one ever uses it.
【Masaya】
Only once.
【Asuka】
I see...
【Masaya】
I went inside and prayed. After that, I never set foot in there again.
I doubt God even lent an ear to someone as impious as me.
【Asuka】
Hm...
Asuka keeps staring at the building for a while.
【Asuka】
Some people pray for victory before tournaments, right?
【Masaya】
Oh, I guess...
【Asuka】
I kind of regret not visiting it now. It's Saturday, so I missed my chance. What a shame...
A prayer for victory, huh? I wonder if that actually helps...
Either way, people usually do that at shrines, so her logic's kinda flawed.
【Asuka】
If only I visited yesterday...
【Asuka】
You can only enter when the school's open, right?
【Masaya】
Oh, uh, there's actually a way around that.
【Asuka】
...Huh?
【Aoi】
Well, I'm surprised Masaya's at school the day before the tournament.
【Aoi】
Strange thing to do on a day off... Well, guess it doesn't matter, since it seems like Kurashina's having fun.
【Aoi】
Oh... I didn't expect another guest.
【Irina】
It's been a while, Ms. Kagami.
【Aoi】
Well, look who we have here. I heard you had an interesting chat with Masaya the other day.
【Irina】
There's something I wish to discuss with you.
【Aoi】
Sorry, I've got no words to spare. I'm not about to consort with the enemy the day before the tournament.
【Irina】
...I've heard whispers that you used the Angelic Halo.
【Aoi】
......
【Aoi】
...Wow, did you send a spy over to our school?
【Irina】
That doesn't matter. I'm only here to confirm that you've gotten serious enough to use that move.
【Aoi】
...Why?
【Irina】
I saw you use the Angelic Halo in the third round of the World Championship. Since then, it's been the only move that I've wanted to recreate.
【Irina】
In a way, it served as the inspiration for the Bird Cage, so I'm excited at the prospect of its inventor unsealing it after all these years.
【Aoi】
...I've got nothing to be proud of. It's a move that made my opponent quit FC, so I only showed it to them to make them realize how big of a taboo it is.
【Irina】
I'm not sure you have the luxury to do that.
【Aoi】
...Oh?
【Irina】
There's something I want to show you.
【Irina】
Please follow me. This should keep you from fainting in fear tomorrow.
【Aoi】
...You better make this worth my while, then.
【Irina】
I promise not to disappoint...
【Asuka】
I hope no one's around...
【Masaya】
I'm sure we're alone. Don't worry.
I unlock the backdoor. Then, we walk right through it.
It's summer and there's no air conditioning in here, but the place isn't stuffy at all.
【Asuka】
I didn't know there was a spare key for the back entrance in a place like that...
【Masaya】
I only found it by chance, so I didn't either.
It just caught my eye one time when I was passing by the chapel.
Gotta make sure to put it back in the switchboard by the door when we leave...
【Masaya】
Now, let's go take care of that prayer!
【Asuka】
O-Okay!
We position ourselves in front of the stained glass.
There's a huge crucifix hanging up there, looming down on us.
【Asuka】
Um, you're supposed fold your hands while you pray, right?
【Masaya】
Yeah, I think so...
【Asuka】
O-Okay, let's try.
We try to fold our hands the proper way, then close our eyes.
【Masaya】
...Please help us win.
【Asuka】
Please help us show... the fruits of our hard work tomorrow!
【Masaya】
You aren't gonna pray for victory?
【Asuka】
Hm, I feel like that won't work. Like, it's almost too much to ask for.
【Masaya】
Really? I kinda feel it's better to think big when you're making a wish...
【Asuka】
Hm... Are you sure?
【Masaya】
Yeah. Just trust me. Ask to get first place.
【Asuka】
O-Okay, then I'll go with that...
Asuka closes her eyes and prays silently.
【Asuka】
I'm all done here.
【Masaya】
Same.
【Asuka】
Phew... Now we just have to win tomorrow...
【Masaya】
Right...
With that, our training finally comes to an end. It's time to strut our stuff.
No one knows how things will turn out tomorrow... Well, except maybe god.
【Masaya】
...Let's get going.
【Asuka】
Okay!
By the time we left, the sun was starting to set.
We slowly made our way down the slope in front of the school and went to the nearby bus stop. Once we got there, the sky was already a light orange.
And right now, Asuka's face is being bathed in that warm hue.
【Asuka】
Zzz... Zzz... Zzz...
【Masaya】
Asuka...
Asuka's sleeping peacefully as she clutches my arm.
I comb through her soft hair with my hand, then gently stroke her head.
【Asuka】
Oh... Masaya-kun...
Can't believe she's saying my name in her sleep...
【Asuka】
Hm... Zzz... Zzz...
Well, guess that was a one-off.
【Masaya】
Man, she's really, <i>really</i> cute.
I know I must sound like a broken record by this point.
And yet, I can't stop.
Asuka's an energetic Skywalker who never gives up, no matter how strong the opponent.
But right now, she looks so delicate and cute that no one would even guess.
【Masaya】
Seriously, how is she so...
I gently stroke her cheek.
She seems so fragile that I'm worried about hurting her.
And yet, I can't think of a stronger, more reliable partner when it comes to FC.
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
...Damn, I have a pretty dirty mind.
We're alone on this bus, so her defenseless face is stirring up certain... fantasies.
I need to make do with just stroking her face, or things'll get <i>real</i> bad.
【Asuka】
Zzz... Huh...?
【Masaya】
Ah...!
Crap, I got startled.
I didn't expect Asuka to wake up, so I hurriedly pulled my hand away.
【Asuka】
Oh, was I sleeping...?
【Masaya】
Yep.
【Asuka】
Oh... Uhhh...
Asuka looks kinda sad, but also frustrated, for some reason.
【Asuka】
I can't believe I'm wasting our time together...
【Masaya】
Hm, I wouldn't say it was a waste. I enjoyed it just fine.
【Asuka】
Huh?
【Masaya】
I got to watch your cute face as you slept!
【Asuka】
...Uh, what?!
Asuka leans into my chest and rubs her head against it.
It's a habit of hers that kicks in when she gets really upset or embarrassed around me.
【Asuka】
I hate you. I <i>totally</i> hate you!
【Masaya】
Seriously?
【Asuka】
......
【Asuka】
Of course not. Come on, you knew that...
【Masaya】
Haha, that's a relief. Lucky me.
【Asuka】
Haaah... Geez... I love you so much that it feels like I'm about to go crazy.
【Masaya】
Honestly, I wouldn't mind seeing that.
【Asuka】
You sure about that? It'll get <i>really</i> bad... Though, to be fair, it already <i>is</i> bad... Still, it'll get worse!
【Masaya】
Sure. Go right ahead.
【Asuka】
H-Hm... Okay, just for bit, then.
Asuka looks around to make sure there are no other passengers before proceeding.
【Asuka】
God... Masaya-kun... Ahhh...
【Masaya】
Uhhh...
Asuka's rubbing her body up against me rather vigorously.
And while she does that, her hand is stroking my arm.
Plus, she's trying to entwine her legs with mine...
【Asuka】
Masaya-kun... I want you to come a lot closer...
She beckons me in a sweet, seductive voice.
【Masaya】
(Shit, this is bad. I've gotta keep calm...)
【Asuka】
Your arm... is <i>sooo</i> big... You must work out a lot.
Damn, this is <i>really</i> effective.
And her body's glued to me, so I can feel her chest directly as well. How am I supposed to control myself?
【Asuka】
Your chest is... so broad... I want to keep doing this forever...
She's rubbing her cheek against my chest as those words leave her mouth.
【Asuka】
I love you... I love you so much...
【Masaya】
H-Hahaha...
The logical half of my brain's starting to melt like ice cream under the summer sun.
Meanwhile, desire is starting to rule my more emotional half.
【Asuka】
...It goes something like that!
Asuka suddenly stops and reverts to her old position.
【Asuka】
I enter that dangerous state when I'm home alone...
【Asuka】
Haaah... I really am hopeless.
She saved me just in the nick of time.
One more second, and I would've done something crazy out here in public.
【Masaya】
I see... I didn't know you had that side.
【Asuka】
...I won't show you it ever again!
【Masaya】
Really? I'd kinda like to see it soon...
【Asuka】
N-Not a chance! I'll get mad if you try to force it out of me!
【Masaya】
What's the big deal? Honestly, I can already picture you hugging your flying fish plushie in a trance at home.
【Asuka】
...Huh?
【Masaya】
That was a joke... Wait, don't tell me you actually do that?!
【Asuka】
I-I hate you...! Oh, but I also love you!
【Masaya】
Hahaha...
【Asuka】
Geez!
The bus rocks as we approach our destination.
【Masaya】
Oh, this next stop is ours.
I press the stop button, which makes the lights in the bus come to life.
Red light washes over the once dimly lit bus.
【Asuka】
Going out to town on the bus was nice.
【Masaya】
Yeah...
I was worried at the start, but...
Well, going places on foot turned out to be a good choice. We had tons of fun.
And hey, a day without flying might just get us more excited to fly tomorrow.
I'm sure Asuka feels that way, at least.
I can't wait to see Asuka spread out her wings and soar higher than anyone else with renewed vigor.
I'm sure it'll be a beautiful sight.
【Masaya】
Almost there. Let's get up now.
The bus takes a sharp right turn.
I can see our stop already.
【Asuka】
Okay, but I need one last thing.
Huh? What does she want?
【Masaya】
Um, okay, but...
【Asuka】
Mmmph...
Asuka plants a kiss on my cheek.
【Masaya】
Ah...
Then, she aims a soft smile at me.
【Asuka】
Ah...!
【Masaya】
Wh-What's wrong?
【Asuka】
W-Well, you know what we did earlier...
【Asuka】
I just started thinking about it, so my body's all hot...
【Masaya】
Oh... Seriously?
I swear, I'm gonna have a heart attack one of these days if she doesn't learn to control herself...
【Aoi】
......
【Aoi】
This is...!
【Irina】
So, what do you say? Did you enjoy my little show?
【Aoi】
Hmph... You could say that.
【Aoi】
In fact, it's making my head spin...
【Irina】
I'm <i>very</i> happy to hear that! It was worth bringing you here, then.
【Aoi】
You're terrifying...
【Irina】
I'm honored to hear such praise from you... Ms. Kagami.
【Irina】
Now, please go tell your disciple all about this.
【Irina】
Tell him that the current brand of FC will come to an end tomorrow.
【Aoi】
Ugh...
【Irina】
Hahahahaha...
After I got home, I decided to hit the hay early.
I knew it'd look bad if I showed up with bags under my eyes after I told all of them to rest up, so I was trying to avoid that.
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
...Only problem is, I can't sleep.
I'm usually still up around this time, so that's probably part of the reason.
But honestly, it's mainly that I'm feeling <i>really</i> nervous right now.
【Masaya】
Guess I should try to distract myself.
I get up and pull open one of my drawers.
And after I do, I'm greeted by the sight of my old FC Grav Shoes.
I quickly pick them up and read the engraved words.
【Masaya】
Turn to the sky, and don't avert your eyes. The answer lies there...
Will I actually find my answer tomorrow?
Will the sky greet me?
Or rather, will I be able to greet the sky?
【Masaya】
God, what am I doing? Enough with the doubts.
I clutch the shoes to my chest as I say that.
I've gotta put on a strong front for Asuka's sake.
I'll guide her tomorrow.
We'll face the sky together, and soar through it tomorrow.
【Masaya】
Huh...?
I wonder who's calling me.
I set a unique ringtone for Asuka, so it's not her. Must be Misaki, Mashiro, or Madoka.
I pick up my phone and check the caller ID.
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
...Aoi-san?
【Asuka】
Haaah... I can't sleep.
【Asuka】
This is bad. I need to be up early tomorrow...
【Asuka】
...Maybe I should add falling asleep to the list of wishes I just made.
【Asuka】
I sure hope I'm not asking Mr. Robot for too much...
【Asuka】
I know you can't fulfill all my wishes, but at least help me out with the tournament and Masaya-kun!
【Asuka】
Oh, and it'd be nice if you could help me get to sleep, too...
【Asuka】
I wonder where that girl lives now, and what she's doing...?
【Asuka】
I hope she's okay... And I hope we'll meet again.
【Asuka】
......
【Asuka】
Hm...
【Asuka】
Haaah... I still can't sleep.
【Asuka】
Oh, right, I'll just think about Masaya-kun!
【Asuka】
Haaah... Yeah, this <i>really</i> helps me unwind...
【Asuka】
This is my Masaya-kun for tonight...
【Asuka】
It's a little embarrassing, but I can't stop...
【Asuka】
You know, Masaya-kun...
【Asuka】
...I'm honestly a little worried about the tournament.
【Asuka】
I mean, I'm sure Inui-san has improved a lot.
【Asuka】
Still, I'm sure it'll be fine... I believe in you, Masaya-kun.
【Asuka】
I just need to do my best, and you'll take care of the rest!
【Asuka】
Right... I need to... do my best...
【Asuka】
Hm... Zzz... Zzz...
【Masaya】
Ms. Kagami.
【Aoi】
Sorry for calling you out here this late, Masaya.
【Masaya】
It's fine. So, what's up?
Hm, she's not responding.
And there's a frown on her face, which I haven't really seen lately. Is something wrong?
【Masaya】
Ms. Kagami...?
【Aoi】
Listen, Masaya...
【Saki】
60, 59, 58...
【Irina】
You can take your time, Saki. This is your last attempt for the day.
【Saki】
Understood, Irina.
【Saki】
51, 50, 49...
【Irina】
It's supposed to be clear out tomorrow. The perfect weather for flying, they say.
【Saki】
There are... lots of stars today.
【Irina】
Oh... You're right. It reminds me of Sark's night sky.
【Saki】
...It was very pretty.
【Irina】
That was shortly after I met you, correct?
【Saki】
...You came and talked to me.
【Irina】
I sure did... Hehe, you seemed to be having a lot of fun as you chased after that cat.
【Saki】
......
【Irina】
I still remember it so vividly... At first, you wouldn't talk to me at all, but then you told me about your wish to fly with such passion in your voice...
【Saki】
...Because I've always wanted to fly.
【Irina】
This really brings me back to all those days we spent perfecting your playstyle.
【Irina】
But now, the time has come. We will finally reveal ourselves to the world at large.
【Saki】
...Yes.
【Irina】
...You've turned into an incredible player.
【Irina】
You've become a Skywalker who can put the true FC I envisioned into practice.
【Saki】
I...
【Irina】
Yes...?
【Saki】
I'm definitely going to win tomorrow... for you...
【Irina】
...Good, Saki.
【Irina】
It seems like we'll have to educate those fools who continue to babble about "having fun" as they fly.
【Irina】
...And perhaps that will knock some sense into <i>her,</i> as well.
【Saki】
...Yes, Irina.
【Irina】
Well then, it's about time for you to come down. We're done with practice, so now you just need to get some proper rest.
【Saki】
Yes...
【Irina】
Why not take a nice long bath to warm up your body? Oh, I suppose we'll have to properly comb your hair after...
【Aoi】
I want you to hear this.
【Masaya】
Hear what, exactly?
【Aoi】
...It's about Saki Inui.
It's hard to cause instantaneous, dramatic changes in the human body. But when it happens, they range from a change in body temperature to a sudden increase in strength.
Basically, news can affect a person both negatively and positively.
I wonder what'll happen here...
【Aoi】
Kurashina will lose at this rate.
【Masaya】
What?!
She can't be serious?!
My blood runs cold, and then my heart starts pounding like crazy before my body temperature skyrockets.
What's that supposed to mean?
Explain yourself, Aoi-san!
Several large fireworks get launched into the sky.
After that, there's a more simplistic opening ceremony than the one from the summer tournament, and each school's team splits up..
With that, the fall tournament, which is also known as the rookie tournament, finally begins.
【Misaki】
Haaah... Today's the day, huh?
【Mashiro】
Oh no... I'm starting to have flashbacks of the summer tournament...
【Madoka】
No worries, Mashirocchi. You've gotten <i>way</i> better thanks to all the practice!
Madoka speaks the truth. Mashiro's improved across the board.
She'll probably get farther into the bracket this time.
【Mashiro】
In that case, my goal is to get past the first round.
【Madoka】
Wow, that's pretty realistic.
【Misaki】
Hm, then I guess I'll go with getting to the third round.
【Masaya】
That's also very grounded.
I'm sure they can manage that.
【Mashiro】
...Though, I'll probably start crying if my first match is against Inui-san.
【Misaki】
Oh, same!
【Masaya】
Even I'd cry...
Unfortunately, with the way the bracket is handled, there's a very real chance of that happening.
Like before, it's totally random. There's no seeding to separate the major players.
【Masaya】
Well, if that does happen, we'll just have to figure out how to put up a good fight.
【Mashiro】
I-I'll at least gather some information for Asuka-senpai!
【Misaki】
Yeah, <i>totally.</i> Stuff like where she's ticklish or if she can handle scary stories is useful, yeah?
...You know, it's probably good that we can joke around about her.
Our chances would be slim if everyone got depressed at the first mention of her name.
【Masaya】
I'm sure that'd make Asuka happy, too... Actually, is she still not here?
【Madoka】
She said she's running late, but she should be here any minute... Oh, there she is. Heeey, over hereee!
【Asuka】
Haaah... Haaah... I-I'm sorry for being late! Good morning everyone!
【Mashiro】
Good morning, Asuka-senpai!
【Misaki】
What happened, Asuka? You sleep in?
【Asuka】
Well, I hate to say it, but yes... I totally slept in.
【Asuka】
And of course my parents slept in today of all days, too...
【Masaya】
Morning, Asuka.
【Asuka】
Y-Yes, good morning, Masaya-san!
【Asuka】
Hm...
【Asuka】
...Hehehe.
【Masaya】
C-Cool it with the grin, Asuka... Don't do that every single time you see my face...
【Asuka】
I-I'm sorry... I'm <i>so</i> sorry!
【Madoka】
...I'd give you a big fat lecture right now if it wasn't time for the tournament.
【Misaki】
I feel like Asuka's falling harder by the day.
【Mashiro】
I'm feeling sick already.
【Asuka】
Sorry, I'll try to be more careful from now on... Uh...
We go to check the bracket after everyone's done calling Asuka out for her pervy behavior.
【Masaya】
There are less participants, huh?
【Madoka】
Because all the seniors have retired, yeah. Though, there are a lot more freshmen this time around, too.
【Misaki】
So basically, the top sophomore's expected to win it all?
【Mashiro】
Sure seems like it.
There are 32 matches in total. That's half as many as the summer tournament.
And thanks to that, the whole thing will finish in one day. Currently, the brackets are separated into two blocks, A and B.
Skywalkers will compete for the top spot in their group of 16, and then the two winners will face each other at the end.
【Asuka】
I can't wait to find out who I'm facing first...
【Misaki】
What if it's me?
【Masaya】
They avoid pairing up people from the same school in the first round.
That's the only thing that affects the otherwise random drawing.
Basically, we just have to pray that we avoid Saki Inui early.
【Misaki】
Y'know, there are lots of seniors around even though they've all retired.
Misaki's right. Seniors often show up to help support their school.
There's a ton of stuff they can do, like teaching the sophomores how to handle leadership or going over how to perform maintenance on Grav Shoes with the freshmen, for example.
【Mashiro】
Oh, by the way, where's Prez?
【Masaya】
He's helping Shirase-san.
【Madoka】
Man, those two <i>really</i> hit it off. They talk about muscles nonstop whenever they meet...
【Misaki】
So he's just here to chat about working out?
【Madoka】
Hahaha... No, he's got actual work, too. I'm pretty sure he'll join us when Asuka-chan's facing Inui-san, though.
Prez is working Shirase-san's stall today to make a little extra on the side.
Though, there's more to it than just that. He's also gonna watch the matches we can't catch and report back to me if necessary.
【Masaya】
Guess we're all good to go at this point...
【Mashiro】
Hm... Let's see... Where's my name...? Huh?!
Mashiro yelps like a beaten dog.
【Misaki】
What's wrong, Mashiro...? Oh, okay, I see. Coool...
I check Mashiro's first round opponent.
【Masaya】
You're playing against... a freshman from Takafuji, huh?
Well, that's a lot better than her opponent at the summer tournament.
【Mashiro】
Ugh... I wish I got an easier opponent...
【Madoka】
Come on, don't pout. It could've been a lot worse. Imagine if you got another sophomore again instead.
【Misaki】
Yeah, Mashiro. Make sure to come fight me in the next round, 'kay?
【Mashiro】
Huh?! Are we in the same block?
【Misaki】
Yep. Look right here!
Misaki points at a position on the bracket that's close to Mashiro's. It's labeled "Misaki Tobisawa."
【Masaya】
Oh, yeah, you guys are actually pretty close to each other.
【Madoka】
Mhm... Though Mashirocchi'll have to reach the third round to face Misaki.
【Mashiro】
Th-The third round...?
Mashiro's eyes start to glaze over.
【Misaki】
Don't worry, you can do it! I'm sure it'll work out if you try hard enough! Just keep winning until you catch up to me, 'kay?
【Mashiro】
O-Okay, I will! I'll <i>definitely</i> reach you, Misaki-senpai!
Misaki's logic makes zero sense, but she's helping Mashiro relax, so I guess it's fine...
【Masaya】
What about you, Asuka?
【Asuka】
Well, um...
I look over to where Asuka's pointing.
She's also in group A, but luckily, she's on the opposite side of Misaki and Mashiro. Unfortunately...
【Masaya】
Oh, okay...
...I see a familiar name close to Asuka's.
【Satouin】
Long have I awaited this moment!
A group of people approaches us from behind as we hear that booming voice.
@delete
【Asuka】
S-Satouin-san!
I turn around and spot a bunch of Takafuji students.
【Satouin】
It's good to see you on this fine day, ladies and gentlemen from Kunahama.
【Satouin】
Have you come here to assess the tournament bracket?
【Masaya】
Yeah, we just found out our matchups.
【Satouin】
Hmph... That means you must know!
She thrusts her hand up into the air after she says that. And then...
【Satouin】
Grant thy azure blessing to mine wings!
【Masaya】
There she goes again...
It's the most... <i>spirited</i> activation key I've heard in my life.
Though, she isn't even wearing her Grav Shoes right now, so I guess she's just trying to pump herself up.
【Satouin】
Asuka Kurashina!
【Asuka】
Y-Yesh!
【Satouin】
It would appear we are fated to meet in the second round.
【Asuka】
Y-Yes... If I manage to win my first match, at least.
【Satouin】
Hmph!
Satouin-san lifts her hand once more as she scoffs.
【Satouin】
I shall be waiting up there for you.
【Satouin】
And once we meet, I will finally avenge the humiliation you made me suffer through after our last match!
【Asuka】
O-Okay, wait for me!
Satouin-san gives her a satisfied nod at last.
【Satouin】
Good luck to the rest of you. I expect to eventually face you in a match, but...
【Misaki】
Oh, it's Satouin-san. Thanks for the food the other day!
【Mashiro】
The fish cakes were <i>really</i> good.
【Satouin】
Please, there's no need for you to express gratitude over such a small favor.
【Satouin】
Wait, no! We are enemies today! This sense of camaraderie is most--!
【Madoka】
Hey, where can I order more of the fish fries?
【Satouin】
Oh, I shall text you the URL later. You will get a discount if I refer you, so do wait.
【Satouin】
Wait, I'm telling you this isn't right! This relaxed atmosphere does not suit a battlefield!
【Rika】
Oh, it's you. Good morning.
【Masaya】
Oh, Ichinose. Good morning.
【Asuka】
Good morning, Rika-chan!
【Satouin】
Heeey! What are you doing, Ichinose-san?! You will soon be named vice president, so please act accordingly!
【Rika】
O-Oh, okay. Sorry!
【Satouin】
It's fine, I suppose. I must go prepare for my first match now, so do excuse me!
Satouin-san walks away, leaving only those words behind.
【Rika】
Let me apologize for Satouin-senpai. She's a lot more worked up than usual because she's the acting president.
【Masaya】
...Figured.
【Rika】
She's been saying, "We must make the first move to prevent the other schools from claiming the upper hand!" as she goes around greeting everyone...
【Rika】
But the truth is, she lights up when other people approach us first, since she's a pretty sociable person.
【Misaki】
Yeah, I can <i>totally</i> see that.
【Mashiro】
Yeah, she's a real good person.
At any rate, that <i>definitely</i> fits my image of Satouin-san.
And hell, I can understand how becoming the president has added a ton of pressure to her plate.
I mean, I'm kinda in the same boat...
【Rika】
Let me just say this, if we face each other, I won't go easy on you.
【Misaki】
Yeah, make sure you keep winning until you reach me and Asuka!
【Rika】
...Right, if I win my first two matches, I'll have to face either Asuka-san or Satouin-san...
Ichinose heaves a sigh.
【Rika】
Anyway, let's all give it our best!
【Misaki】
Sure thing!
【Asuka】
Yeah, let's give it our best!
【Mashiro】
Good luck!
After Ichinose leaves, I check the bracket once more.
Let's see...
【Masaya】
In block A, we have Mashiro, Misaki, and Asuka. Mashiro and Misaki are on the right, while Asuka is on the left. Mashiro and Misaki may run into each other in the third round, but neither of them can meet Asuka before the finals.
【Masaya】
Asuka, on the other hand, might run into Satouin-san in the second round and Ichinose in the third.
【Masaya】
You need four wins to come out on top of the block.
And more importantly...
【Masaya】
Saki Inui is in block B, huh?
None of us are starting anywhere near her.
She's definitely going to dominate her block, so we can only meet her in the grand finals.
【Madoka】
Well, looks like we don't have to worry about knocking each other out until the third round.
【Masaya】
Yeah. Though, if we had at least one person in block B, we could've used that chance to study Inui...
【Madoka】
No point crying over spilled milk. Besides, considering what she pulled at the nationals, she probably won't even show her true colors before the grand finals.
【Masaya】
Good point...
【Madoka】
...If only we had some way to figure out what those "strange movements" Ms. Kagami saw were.
【Masaya】
Yeah...
I relayed Aoi-san's message to Madoka.
【Asuka】
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Yeah! Is that right?
【Misaki】
Sure is. You say "let's go" three times, then finish with a "yeah."
【Mashiro】
Why don't we try punching the air at the end?
Right now, they're practicing how to cheer each other on.
I can't possibly kill this positive atmosphere by bringing that up.
【Masaya】
Strange movements, huh?
【Masaya】
Strange movements...?
【Aoi】
I witnessed some bizarre movements that I can't explain. I don't even think they're possible with normal Grav Shoes or membrane tuning.
【Masaya】
Why does that mean Asuka can't win?
【Aoi】
...It's hard to face the unknown.
【Aoi】
And to make matters worse, you opponent is the insanely strong Saki Inui... If she pulls those off mid-match, you're in for a world of hurt.
【Masaya】
How do I counter them?
【Aoi】
I've got no clue... Well, that's not entirely accurate, but the only idea I have is out of the question.
【Masaya】
And that's what, exactly?
【Aoi】
...I'm sorry, I can't tell you. I know I brought it up, but I'd be abandoning my responsibility as your teacher if I put the idea in your head.
【Aoi】
Just be careful. There's nothing you can do if she chooses to use them against you.
【Masaya】
What could they be?
There's a limit to my imagination.
Picturing something I've never seen before is exhausting, and there's not even much to be gained from the exercise.
【Madoka】
Well, let's just focus on the matches in front of us for now. We'll think about how to counter Saki Inui after we win block A.
【Masaya】
...Yeah, you're right. Let's do it.
【Madoka】
Roger! Let's start our first round meeting, then!
【Madoka】
Hey, giiirls! It's time to talk strategy!
I stand there, gazing up at the sky, as Madoka goes to get the girls.
It's perfectly clear, without a single cloud in sight...
【Masaya】
The answer lies there...
Sure doesn't seem like it...
Still, I can't give up.
At this point, we just have to go out there and show everyone what we can do.
【Referee】
Masked Skywalker from Kamidorisha Academy has won the match 2:0!
Both blocks proceed at the exact same time.
And from what I've seen and heard, there have been no real upsets so far.
We're currently enjoying a break after the second round. It's there to let people plan for their upcoming matches.
【Masaya】
...No real surprises, huh?
All the main contenders that people have their eyes on, like Inui, Misaki, and Asuka, have progressed with little issue.
However, one person I expected a lot from has lost already.
【Satouin】
Hic... Ugh... Hic...
Satouin-san lost her very first match.
It was a bad matchup for her, and she ran out of stamina because her exhaustion piled up, so she lost by a considerable margin.
It's probably a surprise for a powerhouse like Takafuji.
【Satouin】
I-I'm the president, a-and yet I... I lost in the first round... How can I face the others now...?
Satouin-san's weeping all by herself in a corner of the venue.
There's nothing we can really do, so Asuka and I just watch her from behind.
【Satouin】
Ugh... Hic... Waaah...
【Asuka】
Satouin-sa--
I stop Asuka as she tries to approach Satouin-san.
【Asuka】
Huh? Masaya-san, why?
【Masaya】
You've won all your matches, remember? That means you aren't the right person to console her.
【Asuka】
No way...
【Masaya】
Satouin-san has a lot of pride. If you take pity on her here, you'll just end up hurting her even more.
【Masaya】
Besides, she's all worked up right now. We should talk to her later, after she's had time to cool her head.
【Asuka】
Okay...
I pat a dejected Asuka's shoulders before walking over to a different Takafuji member.
【Rika】
Oh, Hinata-san...
Ichinose lost in the second round.
Still, she faced some highly skilled sophomores in both rounds, and the second match was pretty close, so she's got nothing to be ashamed of.
However, it's probably hitting her harder than it should because of Satouin-san's loss.
【Masaya】
It's very unfortunate that you lost, Ichinose...
【Rika】
Yeah... I thought I could get a little bit further.
【Rika】
Unfortunately, no one from Takafuji managed to reach the third round, which isn't a good look for our school.
Yeah, that's not what most people expect from their school.
【Masaya】
I'm really sorry if helping train Asuka wore you out.
【Rika】
No, you have nothing to apologize for.
【Rika】
Our club has been centered around Shindou-senpai this whole time, so we can take these results as a learning experience.
【Rika】
Actually, Satouin-senpai's been handing all the coaching since the summer tournament. She said we needed to learn not to rely on Shindou-senpai.
...I see. Guess that's why he had a lot of free time.
Explains her results, too. Satouin-san probably didn't have much time to practice if she was handling all the coaching.
I'm sure we'll face similar problems when our current sophomores have to graduate.
【Rika】
This tournament may have ended poorly, but we'll come back stronger than ever. You won't even recognize us next year.
【Rika】
...Prepare yourselves.
【Masaya】
...Will do.
【Asuka】
......
【Asuka】
I'm finally starting to understand what losing feels like...
【Masaya】
...Yeah.
【Asuka】
Honestly, I'm a little scared.
【Asuka】
I can't help but wonder if flying's really fun when we're going this far to decide winners and losers...
I stop in my tracks.
【Masaya】
Asuka.
【Asuka】
Yes?
【Masaya】
If you don't find this fun, just drop out of the tournament.
【Asuka】
Huh?!
【Masaya】
There are some who say sports aren't all about winning and losing, but it's normal that people who participate in tournaments are invested in the idea of coming out on top. The rules are based around it, even.
【Masaya】
If you're having any doubts about that, it's better to quit while you're ahead.
【Asuka】
...I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking straight.
Asuka seems pretty upset, so I pat her on the shoulder and smile.
【Masaya】
Don't get me wrong. I know <i>exactly</i> how you feel. I mean, I ended up quitting FC because of that, remember?
【Asuka】
Masaya-san...
【Masaya】
Asuka, when you participate in a tournament, focus only on winning. That'll help everyone else, and make all your practice worth it.
【Asuka】
How will that help?
【Masaya】
You need to show people who have lost how much you enjoy flying.
【Masaya】
Just think, wouldn't it be great if seeing you makes them want to fly again?
【Asuka】
Y-Yes...! Definitely.
【Masaya】
Good. Now, let's go out there and give it our best shot.
【Asuka】
Okay!
【Asuka】
Still, I'm a little worried about Satouin-san...
【Masaya】
Don't worry. I promise she'll be back on her feet with twice the motivation in no time.
【Asuka】
How can you be so sure?
【Masaya】
I just know that girl's quick to recover.
【Satouin】
What do you think you're doing?!
【Madoka】
Uh, what do you mean? Preparing for the upcoming matches, duh.
【Satouin】
Do you not even have proper cheerleaders at Kunahama?! Who will encourage the players during their matches?!
【Madoka】
Cheerleaders...? Um, well, our members just cheer for each other.
【Satouin】
What a hopeless bunch. Very well, then. Rejoice, for I, Reiko Satouin, shall cheer for you as a token of our friendship!
【Madoka】
God, she doesn't even listen! This sucks!
【Masaya】
...See?
【Asuka】
...You were right.
Asuka giggles happily as she watches Satouin-san go back to her usual self.
We've mainly focused on Asuka since the summer tournament, but Mashiro still managed to win her first match, while Misaki made it to the third round.
【Masaya】
You did great out there, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Hehehe... Too bad I got knocked out in the second round...
【Madoka】
Oh, <i>come on,</i> celebrate a little! You opponent may have been a freshman, but you still managed to beat someone from Takafuji!
【Satouin】
And then you proceeded to embarrass us by losing your next match.
【Mashiro】
I-I'm sorry!
【Satouin】
If you actually feel sorry, practice harder! Improve by the next tournament!
【Mashiro】
O-Okay, I will!
You know, I kinda feel like Satouin-san can elevate FC as a whole around here.
She's a local celebrity, so if she keeps this up, who knows what might happen!
【Misaki】
Aight, guess it's time to kick some butt!
Misaki cracks her fingers as she prepares for her next match.
【Mashiro】
Avenge me, Misaki-senpai!
【Misaki】
Sure thing!
Misaki says that, then thrusts one of her hands into the air and leaves.
【Masaya】
Oh, right. Misaki's third round opponent is the same person you lost to, huh?
【Mashiro】
Yeah... Ganeko-san.
Mayu Ganeko. She's a sophomore from Shitou Suisan Academy.
The way she introduced herself to us during the summer tournament left quite an impression...
【Satouin】
Oh, you mean that fake noblewoman?
【Madoka】
Should I mention the irony to her, Hinata-kun? <i>Should I?<i>
【Masaya】
I don't care. Do whatever you want, Madoka. But yeah, she's talking about the older girl that was sort of graceful and refined.
That, uh, system or whatever they have going on at Shitou Suisan really is... interesting.
【Masaya】
Man, Okoze was acting kinda creepy back then...
【Arika】
Don't call me creepy! Wow, you guys are as rude as ever!
【Mashiro】
Ugh... That voice...
【Masaya】
You've been eavesdropping?
【Arika】
Don't call it eavesdropping. I'm here to watch the match and you mentioned my name, so of course I'd respond.
【Masaya】
Your... big sister, was it? She's pretty good. I saw the match just now.
Mashiro didn't stand a chance.
There wasn't any room for her to pull off any tricks. She was better than Mashiro in every single way.
【Arika】
You got that right. Big Sis is <i>super</i> amazing. I doubt Tobisawa-senpai stands a chance, either.
【Mashiro】
Why don't you go help her out instead of wasting your time here, Arika?
【Arika】
She's already done with all her prep! That's why I decided to come here and tease you!
【Mashiro】
God, you're annoying.
【Arika】
How dare you!
【Masaya】
I mean, Mashiro actually managed to make it through the first round, so it seems like she's the one who should be teasing you.
【Arika】
Ugh... Listen, I only lost because I got matched up with a strong opponent. It was bad luck!
【Mashiro】
Yeah, no thanks. She's too annoying to tease.
【Arika】
Wow, you've called me "annoying" two times in less than a minute! Don't get carried away because you won this time!
【Mashiro】
Senpai, can I leave her to you?
【Masaya】
Uh, no... Don't try to shove this kid onto me.
【Arika】
Heeey! Quit treating me like some nasty customer no one wants to deal with!
【Asuka】
G-Guys, the match is starting...
【Arika】
Crap. Well, I'll catch you later, Mashiro!
【Mashiro】
Forget that. Just stay away.
【Masaya】
Good grief...
Once Okoze leaves, I direct my attention to the playing field.
Ganeko-san is pretty good, but it seems like she mostly skates by on experience.
There's a good chance Misaki will win, since her physical abilities let her penetrate most defenses.
【Masaya】
Asuka versus Misaki, huh?
I'd love to see that match.
Misaki's in prime condition, so she's feeling pretty confident.
However...
That confidence crumbles far too easily.
【Misaki】
What's this? Why are you just floating in place...?
【Mayu】
Hehehe... Movement is but one part of FC.
【Misaki】
Ugh...!
Misaki engages her in a dogfight in an attempt to break the stalemate.
But...
【Mayu】
You forgot to guard your sides, Tobisawa-san.
【Misaki】
Wha--!
She easily dodges Misaki's assault.
【Mayu】
That's one point for me.
【Misaki】
Shit...!
Damn, this is bad...
【Arika】
Sweet! Another point! Go, go, Big Sis!
【Masaya】
She's got the timing of your attacks down, Misaki! Watch out for more attacks from the side.
【Misaki】
I know... I know that...
Misaki's visibly frustrated as she stares down her opponent.
【Misaki】
No matter how I attack her... she twists around me in a way that feels <i>super</i> gross...
【Masaya】
Misaki...
【Misaki】
Sorry, Masaya. I think this is as far as I go...
And true enough...
After that, Misaki fails to beat Ganeko-san no matter what she tries.
The match ends with a score of 3:6.
Misaki's out in the third round.
【Arika】
Yaaay! Big Sis wooon!
【Mayu】
Oh my. Thanks for cheering for me, Arika...
Ugh, all that cheering's making us Kunahama students feel even worse.
Misaki comes walking over to us with slumped shoulders.
【Misaki】
Ahaha... I lost.
【Misaki】
Sorry, I probably looked real lame.
【Mashiro】
That's not true.
【Misaki】
Sorry I couldn't avenge you, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Misaki-senpai...
They droop their shoulders and descend into a deep funk.
Sure, we focused mainly on Asuka this time around, but that doesn't mean they're fine with losing.
Unfortunately, Misaki and Mashiro only managed to reach the goals they set for themselves.
Their losses to Ganeko-san must have been an extra bitter pill to swallow because of their history with Okoze.
【Asuka】
......
Asuka's been silently watching them this whole time.
There's something off about her. Something feels... different.
Eventually...
【Asuka】
It's my turn.
...Asuka quietly gets up.
【Asuka】
Misaki-chan.
【Misaki】
Asuka...
【Asuka】
I will avenge you!
That's new.
Asuka's all fired up, almost angry even, as she fly over to first.
【Arika】
Yo, Senpai. How are things looking over here?
【Masaya】
Oh, Okoze... Can't you tell?
【Arika】
Yeah... That's why I'm avoiding them.
Guess she's smart enough to know that's a bad idea. Glad she's not that insensitive.
【Arika】
Listen, this is when your players need you most. You need to cheer them all up.
【Masaya】
Huh...? Wait, you're just assuming Asuka's gonna lose?
【Arika】
Of course! Big Sis is something special. She's a top player in the area, and everyone's got their eyes on--
【Masaya】
Hate to break it to you, but... Asuka won't lose.
【Arika】
I can't believe it! Here I am, trying to cheer you up, and you're just being stubborn! Just you wait, I'll come back and laugh at you once she loses!
Okoze makes that hostile announcement, then quickly disappears.
【Masaya】
Well, what did she expect...?
I scratch my head in confusion
【Masaya】
She'll understand soon enough.
【Mayu】
...Huh?
After winning the race to second, Asuka easily slips behind Ganeko-san and scores a second point.
【Mayu】
...Ah!
Her back's wide open thanks to that, so Asuka goes in to score again.
【Mayu】
...Eek!
Right as Ganeko-san twists her body to regain balance, Asuka disappears with nimble vertical movements, gets behind her, and scores yet again in a matter of seconds.
【Mayu】
Ugh...
Ganeko-san's frantically looking around, seeking a means to escape the vicious cycle she's trapped in.
However, Asuka uses that opening to nail her again.
【Arika】
Oh... Oooh... Ooooooh...
Okoze's beside herself.
Her incoherent groans fill my surrounding as I watch Asuka score point after point.
【Misaki】
Wow... Just... wow. I don't know what to say...
Misaki's dumbfounded by Asuka's display of skill.
But I can sense a profound sense of respect within her voice.
【Misaki】
Asuka... She's using my playstyle...
Misaki's right. Asuka's playing like a pure Fighter.
It kinda feels like she's trying to show Misaki her possible future.
She dishes out more and more perfectly timed attacks and flight maneuvers without pause.
【Masaya】
Oh, you noticed?
【Misaki】
Yeah... I feel real happy right now...
【Misaki】
Thanks, Asuka.
Misaki stretches her back as she says that.
【Misaki】
Man, now I have to keep playing FC...
【Masaya】
Huh? What'd you just say?
【Misaki】
Go on, you need to go congratulate the winner, Coach!
【Masaya】
Y-Yeah...
No way... Was Misaki thinking of quitting FC?
And Asuka... I see.
That was the final match of block A. Now, we've only got the grand finals left.
Asuka won by an insane margin. The final score was 13:0.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san.
Asuka smiles and walks over to me as soon as she lands.
【Masaya】
Congrats, Asuka. You've made it to the grand finals.
【Asuka】
Yes. Did you see how I was playing?
【Masaya】
Yeah, you did great... Misaki was real happy, too.
【Asuka】
I'm glad... I'm so glad to hear that.
Asuka's expression shifts to one of relief.
Guess we were right.
【Asuka】
I feel like I've started to understand what you said to me earlier.
【Masaya】
What part?
【Asuka】
You know...
【Asuka】
The meaning of showing people who have lost how much I enjoy flying.
【Asuka】
I think I get why I need to do that.
【Masaya】
I see...
Asuka's growing with each match.
Talking to her like this has made me realize she really is getting stronger with every second.
【Asuka】
Do you think Inui-san has fun?
【Masaya】
What?
【Asuka】
I mean, do you think she has fun when she's flying?
【Asuka】
I'm wondering if she enjoys it or not.
【Masaya】
Well...
It feels like there's a special bond between Irina and Inui.
I can't tell if it's based on trust or something else entirely, but either way, I doubt fun is anywhere in the picture.
【Masaya】
You just have to teach her, Asuka.
【Asuka】
I do?
【Masaya】
Yeah. You need to teach Saki Inui the sort of flying that you find fun.
However, that isn't going to be easy.
We need to somehow pull out a win in order to do that.
【Masaya】
That's why we can't afford to lose the next match.
【Asuka】
...Okay. I'll <i>definitely</i> defeat Inui-san.
【Asuka】
I'll be counting on your help!
【Masaya】
Yeah, let's win this together!
There's only one person standing between us and total victory.
At long last, the grand finals are about to begin.
We're all gathered at a spot near the playing field that we've been using as a base camp of sorts this whole time.
【Misaki】
Aight, here you go!
Misaki sprays something that's supposed to combat muscle fatigue onto Asuka's legs.
【Asuka】
Wow, that feels nice and cool!
【Satouin】
We cannot risk her body chilling due to that spray. Quickly, someone place a bath towel on her!
【Mashiro】
Can you lend us this towel, Ichinose-san?
【Rika】
Of course. It's all yours!
Asuka's sitting down while everyone else is kicking up a fuss around her. Kinda reminds me of what you see between rounds in a boxing match.
【Madoka】
Well, guess we're ready for the last match.
【Masaya】
Asuka's raring to go, so we're all set.
【Madoka】
It's about time for Shion to join us. Can you go check on him?
【Masaya】
Sure. I'll be right back.
【Shion】
Yo, Hinata.
【Shirase】
Oh, you here to pick him up?
【Masaya】
Yeah... Oh, I didn't know you were here, Shindou-san.
【Shindou】
I couldn't really join the others from Takafuji, so I agreed to help out Shirase-san.
I bet Satouin-san was being all stubborn about handling everything herself.
I understand that, since she's trying to reshape the club and all. Must be hard to change after getting used to having the best amateur in the country on your team.
【Shindou】
I'm assuming you wish to know how the other block went, right?
【Masaya】
Yeah. How'd the matches go?
Their expressions suddenly turn grave.
【Shindou】
Let's start with the bottom line. Obviously, Inui-kun won.
I mean, yeah, of course. Her losing would've been a huge twist.
【Shirase】
As for how she won... Well, let me tell you, it was a sight to behold.
【Masaya】
In what way, exactly?
【Shion】
Inui used the Bird Cage in <i>all</i> of her matches.
【Masaya】
In... all of them?!
She used that overwhelming force in every single one of her matches...
【Masaya】
Does that mean her opponents are...?
【Shindou】
Yeah. They're utterly depressed. I don't doubt that most of them wish to quit FC.
【Shirase】
Can't really blame them. I mean, they worked hard to develop all sorts of skills and come up with all sorts of strategies, but they were all useless.
【Shion】
It was honestly hard to watch.
I bet...
【Masaya】
I don't get why she's using it nonstop when she hid it during the nationals.
【Shion】
Yeah, that's weird...
【Shirase】
I'm just guessing here, but it feels like she's flaunting it.
【Masaya】
What do you mean?
【Shirase】
Like, she's trying to show that FC as we know it is coming to an end or something. I get the feeling she's trying to make sure everyone watching gets that message.
【Masaya】
Ah...!
I see. It's not just about their opponents. They're targeting everyone in the audience, and those watching the broadcast as well.
It's a challenge of sorts. They're daring people to prove them wrong, to show their style isn't the true face of FC.
It feels like Asuka and I have a lot resting on our shoulders at this point.
What will win? Tradition? Or revolution?
【Shirase】
Well, let's just make our way over to the others for now.
【Shion】
Are you going to tag along?
【Masaya】
Oh, no. You guys should head back first. I need some time alone to think.
【Shindou】
Hinata-kun.
【Masaya】
Yeah?
【Shindou】
You'll get stressed out if you overthink things. Relax, then properly guide Kurashina-kun during her match.
【Masaya】
Will do. Thanks for the advice!
【Shindou】
I'm glad you understand. I'll be rooting for you from the stands.
Our conversation ends there, and the three of them walk off toward our base camp.
I alone remain there, brooding over the upcoming match.
I know Shindou-san's right.
FC is a sport where split-second decision making is crucial, which is why overthinking things is a bad idea. You lose flexibility, and with it, the ability to make the right calls.
But... this match is special for a wide variety of reasons. We've got a lot riding on it.
The version of FC we've been playing this whole time is on the line... and it's the same thing Aoi-san's been trying to protect.
I can't admit defeat to them, no matter what.
【Masaya】
Oh... The wind's picking up.
The air was calm until now, but I can feel a gentle breeze start to blow in from the east.
Loose stalks of grass take to the sky and float over toward the playing field.
I turn to the west, toward the sun.
And there, I spot her.
【Irina】
Oh my... We haven't seen each other in a while.
【Masaya】
Irina-san...
The smile on her face is the same as when we first met.
However, I find myself unable to look straight at it this this time.
【Irina】
It seems like the wind has picked up.
【Masaya】
Yeah. It's not strong enough to delay the tournament, though.
【Irina】
Wind is considered an extremely important factor in English tournaments. You should come watch one sometime.
【Masaya】
I'd love to do that if I ever get a chance.
What is she hiding behind her smile?
What does she want to build after destroying our FC?
I don't have the answer to either of those questions, so all I can do is oppose her.
【Asuka】
Phew... I'm starting to feel a little nervous... Where'd Masaya-san go?
【Asuka】
Huh? Is that...?
【Asuka】
Inui-saaan, Inui-saaan!
【Saki】
...Ah!
【Asuka】
It really <i>is</i> you! Long time, no see!
【Saki】
......
【Asuka】
H-Huh? What, you don't want to talk to me?
【Saki】
...No. That's not it.
【Saki】
I've just... never talked to an opponent before a match. This is a first.
【Asuka】
I see! I'm your first, huh?
【Saki】
Oh...
【Asuka】
Why don't we chat for a bit?
【Saki】
Okay...
【Masaya】
Congrats. I knew you'd win your block.
【Irina】
Thank you. You also performed well. Congratulations.
【Masaya】
I heard you used it in all your matches.
【Irina】
Used what?
【Masaya】
The Bird Cage.
【Irina】
Yes, we did. What about it?
【Masaya】
It feels wrong.
【Irina】
Why?
【Masaya】
Because it sucks all the joy out of Flying Circus.
Another gust of wind blows past us again.
This time, it's a lot stronger. I hear some voices in the distance complaining. Maybe something near the venue got blown away?
I also hear excited voices, educational info, and plain old chatting, all of which seem full of life.
【Masaya】
Remember how you once asked me whether the circus part, all those Airkick Turns, Cobras, Suicidas, and so on, were really necessary?
【Irina】
Of course.
【Masaya】
Well, I have my answer now.
【Irina】
...May I hear it?
【Masaya】
It is necessary. In fact, it's the very heart and soul of FC.
【Asuka】
You're amazing, Inui-san! How'd you get so good?
【Saki】
It's because... I have something dear to me...
【Asuka】
Something dear to you?
【Saki】
You don't... have anything like that?
【Asuka】
Me? Hm, well, yeah, I do...
【Saki】
What is it...?
【Asuka】
Who, not what. My coach, Masaya-san.
【Asuka】
He's the one who taught me the joy of flying!
【Saki】
...I see. I also have someone dear to me.
【Asuka】
Is that person Irina-san?
【Saki】
Yeah... Irina is very precious to me. She's been supporting me for as long as I can remember.
【Saki】
I must win for her sake.
【Asuka】
Challenge accepted! I won't lose to you!
【Saki】
Ah...!
【Asuka】
Honestly, I'm a little scared of you, but I've also been looking forward to our match for a while.
【Saki】
You have...?
【Asuka】
Yeah, I can't wait!
【Asuka】
After all, FC is <i>super</i> fun!
【Saki】
......
【Masaya】
Flying Circus is about having fun. It's about captivating people's attention and entertaining them with the joys of flying.
【Irina】
......
【Masaya】
If all you're after is the experience of flying, hop on a plane. Flying with your own wings is about so much more than that.
I've been searching for this answer since the summer tournament.
And like my shoes said, the answer really was in the sky.
The sky is an endless source of fun and excitement.
And so, a sport that revolves around dashing through the sky needs to emulate that.
The person who came up with FC clearly understood that, since "circus" is even a part of its name.
I now know that I have to protect that name from her and Inui.
【Masaya】
...I swear on the name of our beloved sport that we won't lose to you.
Irina-san's smile disappears.
She goes silent as soon as I finish giving my answer.
How long is this gonna last? It feels like an eternity, but...
【Irina】
How ironic. Those are the same words my sister said...
【Masaya】
Huh...?
【Irina】
Pardon me. It was nothing...
A smile slowly forms on her face after she says that.
【Irina】
...You really are an amusing man, Hinata-san.
【Irina】
Fine. Let us determine which part is more important once and for all. The flying, or the circus.
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Saki】
It's almost time... for the match.
【Asuka】
Oh, hold on, Inui-san!
【Saki】
Hm...?
【Asuka】
Can we be friends once the match ends?
【Saki】
You... want to be friends...?
【Asuka】
Yes!
【Asuka】
I'm really, <i>really</i> interested in you as a player. I want to talk a lot more!
【Asuka】
Besides, you're <i>super</i> cute!
【Saki】
Ah...!
【Saki】
Th-That's not... true...
【Asuka】
You can't be serious. Of course you're cute!
【Saki】
I'm not... cute. And.... becoming friends... is not possible, but...
【Saki】
Chatting after the match... is fine...
【Asuka】
Wow, great! It's a promise, then!
【Saki】
Yes... a promise...
【Masaya】
I'm back... Oh, where's Asuka?
【Madoka】
She went out for a walk. Should be back by now, though...
【Satouin】
Oh, there she is!
【Asuka】
I'm back!
【Misaki】
You've been gone for ages! Where'd you go?
【Asuka】
Oh... I just went to see a friend!
【Madoka】
A friend...? What, like someone from your old school?
【Asuka】
No, a girl I'm going to become friends with <i>really</i> soon.
【Mashiro】
Wh-What...?
【Masaya】
We need to get ready, Asuka.
【Asuka】
Yes, Masaya-san...!
Asuka and I make our way over to the playing field.
And when we get there, I see the whole Kairyou team on standby.
Eventually, I hear a familiar voice call out from behind me.
【Aoi】
Yo. I see you're working hard.
【Misaki】
Oh, Ms. Kagami!
【Mashiro】
I didn't think you were coming!
【Aoi】
Sorry I took so long... Work ran longer than I expected.
Aoi-san approaches the others, then directs her gaze at me.
【Aoi】
......
She gives a quick nod, and I respond in kind.
We share no words because we have no need for them.
At this point, I just have to pour everything I have into this match.
【Masaya】
(I'm still worried about what Aoi-san told me, though...)
Well, I can deal with that when it comes up. The first step is showing off the fruits of our labor.
We won't stand a chance unless we do that.
【Masaya】
Okay, it's time.
The match is about to start, so I tell Asuka to head over to first.
I can practically feel the excitement in the air.
【Minori】
Ladies and gentlemen, the time has finally come for the fall tournament's grand finale! Just like last time, I promise to give you well curated commentary with my pretty voice. I'm the one, the only, Precure Minori!
【Minori】
One of our finalists is the winner of the summer nationals, the "Monarch of the Skies," Saki Inui.
【Minori】
And her opponent, looking to cause an upset here today, is an up-and-coming player who's been improving at an astounding rate since her unfortunate third-round loss at the summer tournament. The "Magician of the Azure," Asuka Kurashina!
【Minori】
Which of these two will be crowned the next Shitou champion?! Tune in to find out!
"Magician of the Azure"... What a crazy nickname.
Though, it's quite fitting.
After all, she's going to put on a magic show to dazzle the crowd and unseat the foul king.
【Misaki】
Asukaaa! I'll treat you to some udon if you wiiin!
【Mashiro】
And I'll get you some strawberry pocky!
【Madoka】
It's finally starting... Seeing Asuka in the grand finals really tugs at your heartstrings, huh?
【Shion】
Yeaaaah, Kurashina! You need speed! Spirit and speed! Oh, and also muscles!
【Shindou】
Well, this is rather exciting, isn't it, Satou-kun?
【Satouin】
...Yes, indeed. Also, it's Satouin.
【Rika】
Asuka-san... Good luck!
【Shirase】
Masayaaa, make sure you don't lose your cool! We've got your baaack!
【Aoi】
......
【Irina】
Play the same as usual, Saki. Do not hesitate.
【Saki】
Yes, Irina.
【Masaya】
Remember, Asuka, all of us believe in you, so go out there and have fun.
【Asuka】
Okay...! I can hardly contain my excitement!
【Masaya】
...Perfect. That's the way.
I give Asuka a thumbs-up.
Eventually, the referee moves their whistle to their lips.
【Asuka】
......
【Saki】
......
Then, they pause for a moment amidst the tense atmosphere.
And after that...
...a whistle resounds through the clear blue sky.
【Saki】
...I'll head out first.
Inui moves toward second right as the match starts.
Her body rises up for a moment, and I immediately realize that's intentional.
【Masaya】
I see... She's using the wind!
Inui uses the gust of wind that's blowing up from above to skillfully carve a path to second.
A human-size gap opens up between her and Asuka, who's also trying to make her way to the buoy.
【Minori】
What's this?! Is Inui trying to replicate her summer tournament performance?! She quickly moves into a Low Yo-Yo to accelerate! Kurashina's trying her hardest to keep up, but that seems unlikely!
【Madoka】
No, she took the lead!
【Misaki】
Dammit, she's <i>really</i> fast...
【Satouin】
Asuka Kurashina is a pure All-Rounder. The cards are stacked against her in a race.
That's normally true, but we've got something up our sleeve.
【Masaya】
Asuka, go.
【Asuka】
You want me to use it right away?
【Masaya】
I don't want to hold anything back. We need to go full throttle right out of the gate, and never pull back. Otherwise... we won't win.
【Asuka】
...I understand.
【Asuka】
Here I go!
Right after she says that...
【Saki】
Huh...?!
【Irina】
No way, how is she so fast?!
Asuka, who was slowly being left in the dust by Inui, abruptly picks up speed and overtakes her.
【Shion】
Wh-What is that?! Her speed just jumped?!
【Shirase】
That's a pretty interesting idea, Masaya.
The gap between them eventually widens to a point where Inui has to give up on the buoy and jump to the second line.
Moments later, Asuka reaches second.
【Minori】
Wh-What a stunning development! Kurashina, who was initially behind, suddenly accelerated and stole the first buoy touch!
With that, the score's 1:0. Asuka's taken the lead for the very first time.
【Mashiro】
Yay! Asuka-senpai did it!
【Misaki】
I don't get it, what was that?!
【Madoka】
I've got no clue. She just sped up somehow...
【Satouin】
P-President, what happened...?
【Shindou】
Ms. Kagami, I find this hard to believe, but...
【Aoi】
...I know what you're getting at. Yeah, it's probably based on my move.
【Shindou】
So it is based on the Angelic Halo...
【Rika】
W-Wait, didn't she only see it for the first time three days ago?
【Misaki】
They practiced alone the next day. Guess they must've worked on this together.
【Madoka】
...Could they really have mastered this in a single day?
【Shindou】
In my opinion, it would take at least a week.
【Aoi】
Common sense doesn't apply to them, huh?
Shindou-san and Aoi-san are right on the money. We've used the concept behind the Angelic Halo to help up Asuka's speed.
Think of it like a nitro boost in a car. It doesn't last very long, but the quick burst of speed can help you get ahead in a race.
Though, since it's a variation of the Angelic Halo, you can only keep flying straight for about two seconds.
Any longer and it gets too hard to maintain the proper form. And in the worst case scenario, you'll end up flying in an arc before you shoot out of the playing field.
However, thanks to Asuka's improved sense of balance, she can recover after those two seconds and chain it into another boost.
That's how she managed to get down the first line so fast.
From here on out, we can use that to get the edge when Inui's flying by Asuka's side.
Though, I wonder if it'll actually work... I kinda assume Inui and Irina-san will think of some countermeasure before attacking us.
【Asuka】
I did it!
【Masaya】
Yeah! But watch out for her next move, Asuka.
Asuka quickly recovers her form, which was slightly off because of the boost from touching second.
Meanwhile, Inui's up above the second line with her arms spread wide.
【Saki】
...I'm ready.
【Irina】
Good, then let's proceed. Use Bird Cage Mark II.
【Saki】
Okay.
For some reason, Inui's leaning forward as she advances toward Asuka with her spread out arms.
【Masaya】
Bird Cage Mark II?! They've improved it already?!
【Minori】
It looks like things are heating up! Inui's charging toward her opponent with her Bird Cage, the move that crushed every single person she faced in her block.
【Mashiro】
Oh no, it's the Bird Cage...
【Misaki】
And she just called it the Bird Cage Mark II... Does that mean it's a lot stronger?
【Shion】
She didn't use it in any of her other matches.
【Shindou】
Most likely because she didn't need to.
【Rika】
Why?
【Shirase】
This version seems to involve charging your opponent, which isn't how she normally does things.
【Aoi】
Yeah, she's got no reason to do that if she's already in the lead.
【Satouin】
I see. That makes a lot of sense. After all, she dominated all the matches in her block from the very start.
Of course they added a more direct offense option to the Bird Cage. They're not dumb enough to assume they'll always start with a lead...
【Masaya】
Glad I guessed that already!
Asuka seems prepared to intercept the encroaching Inui.
【Asuka】
I'm good to go!
【Masaya】
Okay, there's no time like the present. Use Pentagram Force!
Asuka nods, then flies up and to the right in order to get into Inui's blind spot.
【Saki】
Upward? Does she mean to attack with a Low Yo-Yo...?
Right when Inui looks up...
【Asuka】
Sorry, but you guessed wrong!
...Asuka starts to draw a pentagram with her flight path.
【Saki】
This movement...!
【Irina】
A polygon attack chain... I can't believe she actually mastered it.
Inui stops in her tracks, looking almost scared for a moment.
【Rika】
Sh-She did it! Inui-san stopped moving!
【Shindou】
She pulled it off perfectly. I must say, this makes all the practice worth it.
【Aoi】
Yeah, it's doing its job well. Even Inui has to think twice before trying to break through that thing.
【Aoi】
Pentagram Force, huh...? That's a great name for the move.
【Mashiro】
Still, it sounds a little, huh...
【Misaki】
...Edgy? Yeah, Masaya's a </i>total</i> edgelord.
【Masaya】
Hey! I can hear you guys!
【Madoka】
Let's start calling him Pentagram-kun after the match.
【Mashiro】
I'd prefer Pen-chan.
【Misaki】
Pen-chaaan, we're rooting for youuu!
【Masaya】
Dammit... I swear, they never let up.
How dare they make fun of it?! I thought long and hard before I eventually came up with that amazing name!
【Madoka】
What do you think, Satouin-san?
【Satouin】
......
【Madoka】
...Something wrong?
【Satouin】
It's... very cool...
【Madoka】
Huh...?
【Irina】
Saki... Listen to me, alright?
【Saki】
Yes.
【Irina】
She'll catch you if you rush in from the front, so slowly circle her while I analyze the situation.
【Irina】
I assume she'll attempt to slip past your side if you move too quickly, so be careful. Considering how fast she was earlier, it would be a mistake to underestimate her speed just because she's an All-Rounder.
【Saki】
Yes, Irina.
Inui's floating about to make sure she's always facing Asuka. Guess they're probably thinking strategy right now.
Not that it matters much. I can tell they're just gonna go for Asuka's back the moment we attack.
【Asuka】
What should we do, Masaya-san?
【Masaya】
Don't hesitate. Just remember what we practiced, and execute it flawlessly.
【Asuka】
...Okay!
Unfazed by Inui's diversion, Asuka does an Airkick Turn when she reaches one of the vertices of her pentagram.
【Asuka】
Take this!
Then, she uses the small opening we've created to rush toward Inui from the side.
【Saki】
...Easy!
Inui clearly has insane reflexes, since she manages to dodge our attack and tries to counter it in one smooth motion.
But...
【Masaya】
...That's not all we've got in store!
Asuka nails a short turn and suddenly appears on Inui's other side.
【Saki】
Ugh... I won't let you...!
Inui manages to react in time yet again. And this time, she twists her body in order to protect her back.
However...
【Asuka】
If that's what you're going to do...
【Asuka】
...two can play that game!
Inui has her back to Asuka, but she twists and bends in unbelievable directions as she extends her hand toward her.
And then, she successfully lands a hit.
【Saki】
Ugh...!
【Irina】
S-Such incredible flexibility...!
【Minori】
Kurashina has scored a point in a dogfight, which puts Inui two points behind!
That brings the score to 2:0.
【Misaki】
Aiiight!
【Madoka】
She did it!
【Shion】
2:0! She has a two point lead now! Yeaaaaaah!
【Mashiro】
This is all thanks to her practice with you, Shindou-san!
【Shindou】
Oh, I doubt that. Kurashina-kun deserves all the praise for actually mastering everything in such a short time.
【Satouin】
...Exactly.
【Shindou】
It seems like there's been something on your mind this whole time, Satou-kun. Care to share?
【Satouin】
President, um... can you please help train our younger players after the tournament?
【Shindou】
...I thought you wanted me to remain uninvolved.
【Satouin】
I did, but this display is showing me that I should not be so stubborn. I wouldn't dare get stuck in my ways after seeing how much Kunahama has improved.
【Satouin】
Your help is more than welcome. In fact, I insist that you aid us with Ichinose-san's training.
【Shindou】
......
【Shindou】
...Okay, Satouin-kun.
【Rika】
Satouin-senpai...
【Shirase】
Seems like everything's going just fine.
【Aoi】
Yeah...
【Shirase】
Think she's gonna pull out the ace up her sleeve?
【Aoi】
No, not yet. I'm sure she'll wait until the end of the match.
Inui uses the repulsion from Asuka's blow to propel herself toward third.
Gotta say, her quick thinking and fast reaction times clearly show that she's playing at the highest possible level.
【Asuka】
Oh no, she's going to reach third...
【Masaya】
It's okay, there's nothing you can do. Listen, just jump to the next line.
【Asuka】
Roger!
Inui touches third and scores her first point as Asuka jumps to the third line.
The score's now 2:1. Asuka's lead has diminished.
【Minori】
Inui has scored a point to make up for her loss in the dogfight! This is starting to look rather interesting! Now, will Inui even the score, or will Kurashina manage to pull further ahead?!
【Irina】
Saki, let's return the favor in the next dogfight.
【Saki】
Understood, Irina.
Inui uses the boost from touching third to rush down the third line.
She's heading straight for Asuka...
They seem to be ditching their earlier plan at this point, since Inui's not worrying about positioning or anything.
Have they realized that as things stand, it's better for them to make this a fast, hectic match to force a misplay?
That's fine by me. I welcome the challenge.
But you know, the most terrifying attacks in these situations always make use of gravity in some way.
And that means...
【Masaya】
There's no way she's gonna shoot straight for you. I'm sure she'll try to enter a climb, then swoop down.
The question is, will she go for a feint and attack Asuka's blind spot when that happens?
She could do that, but there are also a ton of other options. Betting on a specific scenario is too much of a risk.
【Masaya】
Think you can react in time and counter her attack, Asuka?
【Asuka】
I'll try!
Asuka leans forward slightly to prepare herself for Inui's assault.
It's an extremely flexible stance that will allow her to move in any direction on short notice.
【Asuka】
Go on, attack from any angle! I'm... ready?!
Inui suddenly disappears as she closes in on Asuka.
【Asuka】
Wh-Whoa, where'd she go?!
【Masaya】
She's coming from above, Asuka!
【Asuka】
Eek!
Asuka manages to dodge Inui's attack by a hair's breadth.
【Minori】
How impressive! Inui launched her attack by rocketing up directly in front of her opponent, then swooping down! That unexpected maneuver seems to have caught Kurashina off guard!
【Irina】
You have her on the ropes, Saki. That was a well executed attack.
【Saki】
Thank you. I was close.
【Saki】
I won't let you get away next time.
【Asuka】
Eek! T-Time to run!
At that point, Inui takes charge of the action.
【Asuka】
Ugh... Ah, oh no...
Asuka twists her body as bends her upper half backward in order to escape Inui's endless avalanche of attacks.
【Saki】
Tenacious... How about this, then?
She says that, then flies a large arc in an attempt to target Asuka's blind spots.
【Asuka】
Eek! Oh no... Ugh...!
Inui's fists rain down on all of Asuka's blind spots in short order.
Left, right, up, down... Asuka's targeted from every single direction, but she somehow managed to dodge everything while letting out those weird yelps.
【Minori】
Oh my, this is quite a ferocious barrage of attacks from Inui! How much longer can Kurashina hold out?
Inui doesn't stop, doesn't tire. Her hands are moving so fast that they seem to be both nowhere and everywhere at the same time.
【Mashiro】
Oh no, Asuka-senpai is...!
【Misaki】
Chill out, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Misaki-senpai...?
【Misaki】
Doesn't this seem kinda familiar?
【Mashiro】
......
【Mashiro】
...Ohhh!
【Misaki】
She's got this.
Misaki's right.
This is something we've been training to counter since the summer tournament.
【Masaya】
Asuka.
【Asuka】
Y-Yes...!
【Masaya】
Once you get used to the rhythm of her attacks, go on the offense.
【Asuka】
Understood!
Asuka slips out of the way of Inui's attacks every single time.
And as time goes by, her movements grow more smooth.
【Asuka】
This is Prez...!
Her first hurdle is consecutive attacks from above and below.
In other words, attacks based on speed, which Prez excels at.
【Asuka】
This is Mashiro-chan!
The second is a surprise attack from her blind spot.
It comes flying in from behind right as she's trying to calm her breathing.
【Asuka】
And this is Misaki-chan...!
And finally, swift left and right movement that link to rapid attacks.
It's just like the move strings Misaki's so good at pulling off.
【Asuka】
They were way, <i>way</i> harder to dodge!
Well, yeah. Inui's attacks are coming one after another instead of all at once.
【Minori】
A-Amazing! This is simply amazing!
There's no way Asuka, who's mastered dealing with all of those attacks at the same time, will lose here.
【Minori】
Kurashina's nimbly weaving through Inui's chain of blows!
【Minori】
It looked like each of those attacks would hit their mark, yet none of them have!
【Saki】
S-She dodged... all of them?!
【Irina】
Saki, be careful!
【Saki】
...Huh?!
It's too late... Asuka already has the high ground!
【Asuka】
Here I come!
Inui's hesitating as she thinks over what to do next.
【Asuka】
Take this hyper Low Yo-Yo I developed thanks to everyone's help!
Luckily, that's all the time we need. Asuka spins down toward Inui's back like a drill in order to score another point.
【Saki】
Ugh...!
【Minori】
Scoooooooore! Kurashina has scored her third point!
It's 3:1 now.
We've finally reclaimed our two point lead.
【Saki】
Ah...!
Because Asuka was spinning when she touched her back, Inui is completely off balance.
【Shindou】
Wow, that was amazing!
【Satouin】
What fantastic maneuvering... Truly a sight to behold!
【Rika】
We did it, guys!
【Madoka】
Yeah. This was a team effort.
【Misaki】
I knew this would happen! No way Asuka'd lose one-on-one when she can hold her own against all three of us at the same time!
【Mashiro】
P-Prez, how much time is left?!
【Shion】
Th-Three minutes! If she can hold out that long...
【Misaki】
Asuka will...
【Madoka】
...win!
【Rika】
You...
【Rika】
You can do it, Asuka-san!
【Shirase】
...Think they'll bust it out now?
【Aoi】
...Yeah.
【Shirase】
Dammit... Is there <i>really</i> nothing they can do, Aoi?
【Aoi】
Fact is, Irina Avalon outsmarted us by focusing on areas other than the players... There's nothing more we can do at this point.
【Shirase】
I know... You're right, but...
【Shirase】
...I can't just stand and watch as she tears down everything we stood for.
【Aoi】
......
【Aoi】
...I know how you feel.
【Shirase】
Aoi...
【Aoi】
But this isn't our battle to fight. It's theirs.
【Aoi】
Even if it leads to an undesirable outcome, us spectators have no right to interfere.
【Aoi】
Don't you agree?
【Shirase】
......
【Shirase】
...Yeah, you're right.
【Aoi】
Let's watch this until the end. Only they can decide the future of FC.
【Irina】
Three minutes left... It's time.
【Irina】
Saki, are you ready?
【Saki】
Yes... I'm sorry I allowed her to take the lead.
【Irina】
You aren't to blame. Asuka Kurashina was far better than we expected. That said, the situation itself is still well within expectations.
【Saki】
......
【Irina】
Let's crush their hopes and dreams.
【Saki】
...Yes.
【Irina】
Only even the score. We need to force the match into overtime to grant them a taste of true despair.
【Irina】
After this, they will never think FC is fun again...
【Saki】
Yes, Irina.
Inui suddenly starts hugging her knees.
【Masaya】
...What's she doing?
【Asuka】
Good question.
This is <i>really</i> weird.
【Saki】
...Agravain, second phase.
Oh, it seems she was bending over to touch her shoes.
【Saki】
...Here I come.
Inui announces her imminent action, then raises her arms over her head and leaps in a manner reminiscent of a backward dive.
And when she does, her shoes glow for a moment.
【Asuka】
Inui-san?
What the hell is happening?!
【Asuka】
Huh...?
Inui's moving like a fish swimming through water.
【Asuka】
Huh? What? Whaaat?!
She closes in on Asuka with wild, curving motions that are extremely fast and hard to predict.
【Asuka】
Oh no!
Asuka hurriedly dives to the side.
【Saki】
Hehe...
And a smile rises to Inui's face when she sees her getting all flustered.
【Masaya】
I see...
I'm sure these are the "strange movements" Aoi-san mentioned.
【Asuka】
Haaah... Haaah... Haaah...!
It's clear from her face that Asuka's currently being ruled by her fear of the unknown.
【Masaya】
Wh-What... is... that?
【Asuka】
Wh-What is this?!
We fear what's going on in front of us without even knowing what it is.
【Minori】
Oh, uh, um...
【Minori】
Um, Inui's movements have become far more smooth and fluid, like that of a fish, thanks to the change in her Grav Shoe settings... That said, I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
【Minori】
A-Anyway, Kurashina, who had the advantage, is now in a bind! Can she escape?!
【Asuka】
Wh-What do I do, Masaya-san?!
【Masaya】
Speed! Use the Angelic Halo variant to get to the next buoy!
【Asuka】
O-Okay!
Asuka makes a run for fourth at top speed.
【Saki】
You stay.
However, Inui suddenly appears in front of her to block the path. What the hell, did she just teleport?!
【Asuka】
Ah... Oh no...!
It seems like Asuka's starting to lose hope.
【Masaya】
Don't give up, Asuka! Up! Fly upward!
【Asuka】
U-Upward, yeah...!
Asuka makes a desperate attempt to enter a climb, since that seems to be her only option at this point.
【Saki】
I won't let you.
Dammit, we can't shake her! She's like a bloodhound out there!
Inui easily blocks Asuka's path again.
【Asuka】
Eeeeeek!
No way... This is terrifying...
【Asuka】
Masaya-san, Masaya-san... Help... Please help!
No matter where she tries to go...
【Asuka】
Help!
No matter how much she struggles...
...Inui always intercepts her.
【Saki】
...That's one.
【Asuka】
Ah...!
【Saki】
And now... we're even.
【Asuka】
Ah... Aaaaaah!
We had to work incredibly hard to get that two point lead.
But somehow, she's made it vanish in a single moment.
【Masaya】
This can't be happening...
All of a sudden, there seems to be an impossibly wide gap between them.
【Masaya】
How are we supposed to fight that?!
I glare at Inui as I gnash my teeth.
I know this won't change anything, but I'm finding it hard to keep my anger in check.
【Asuka】
Eek... N-Noooooo!
【Saki】
......
Asuka's getting destroyed up there.
She's all alone, without any hope of getting help...
【Masaya】
She... isn't scoring more points?
Inui's toying with Asuka, but she makes no attempt to finish her off.
It almost feels like she's an alpha dog trying to assert dominance through fear.
【Irina】
Hinata-san...! Hinata-san! Can you hear me?
【Masaya】
Irina-san...?
【Irina】
Did you really think the Bird Cage was my only method of changing FC?
【Masaya】
So you're saying... these movements are part of your "true FC"?
【Irina】
Yes. Soon, FC will be centered around purging all unnecessary elements, so both these movements and my strategies will have a starring role.
【Masaya】
Then... why aren't you finishing her off?
【Irina】
This is the end of FC as we know it... so I want to celebrate the moment with a spectacular curtain call.
【Irina】
If they remain tied, we'll proceed to overtime... Just imagine watching Asuka get toyed with, unable to fight back, for five whole minutes... I'm sure it will make for something quite marvelous.
【Masaya】
That's... despicable!
【Irina】
You can just stand there and watch as your precious FC burns to the ground!
【Irina】
And then, my true FC will rise from the ashes!
【Masaya】
Ugh... Goddammit!
Just like Irina-san said, Inui keeps toying around with Asuka the whole time.
【Minori】
That's time! And the score is even, which means we'll be entering overtime for the first time in this tournament's history! The match will resume after a short ten minute break.
【Minori】
Who will emerge the victor?! Will it be Kurashina, who gained the early advantage and led for the majority of the match?! Or will it be Inui, who miraculously clawed her way back in the final stretch?! Stay in your seats because you won't want to miss the exciting conclusion!
【Misaki】
What... was that?
Misaki's voice is shaky.
Everyone's taken aback by Inui's outlandish display.
【Mashiro】
A fish...? Or bird...?
【Madoka】
Inui-san <i>is</i> wearing Grav Shoes, right?
【Satouin】
I have no idea. President, can you explain?
【Shindou】
Does the look on my face suggest I know something?
【Satouin】
...I'm sorry.
【Aoi】
It's the second form of her Agravains.
【Mashiro】
Agravains... That's the model Inui-san uses, right?
【Misaki】
What's the second form?
【Aoi】
It's an entirely new concept that ignores conventional settings like Speeder and Fighter.
【Rika】
I've never heard of anything like that...
【Aoi】
Of course you haven't. They're still under development in Europe, so that isn't public knowledge.
【Madoka】
Shouldn't she be disqualified for using them?
【Aoi】
No. Their specs are in line with the rules. Basically, that second form is just a change in tuning.
【Misaki】
Oh, then let's just do the same to Asuka's shoes.
【Aoi】
We can't just try to copy them on a whim. None of us know the exact settings, so for all we know, Asuka could just lose control in the middle of the match. They've spent years researching and developing this technology, remember?
【Aoi】
Agravains or not, I doubt anyone else can replicate her playstyle.
【Shindou】
There's nothing we can do, huh?
【Aoi】
That's not for us to decide... right, Masaya?
【Masaya】
...Yeah. I won't give up.
There's no way I'll throw in the towel when we've worked so hard to get here.
【Aoi】
Good... Unfortunately, you have no way to counter her right now.
【Masaya】
Say, Ms. Kagami, do you mind sharing that crazy idea you mentioned yesterday?
【Aoi】
I told you to forget I ever said anything...
【Masaya】
I know. I don't want to force it out of you, but it's the only chance we have.
【Aoi】
...Listen, Masaya, this isn't worth the risk.
【Aoi】
People often claim that a one percent chance to succeed is more than good enough, but that's idiotic. You can't just ignore the 99 other scenarios where you fail.
【Aoi】
As your teacher, I refuse to let you bet everything on a miracle, Masaya. You'll have a better shot at winning if you just fight them head-on.
【Masaya】
Damn, I get that, but still...
I look over to Asuka, who's still rooted to the spot.
【Asuka】
......
We were in the lead for the longest time, so I'm not surprised she's shocked by this turn of events.
Still, we need to come up with a plan. If we head into overtime like this, we're doomed.
And that goes for our FC as well. If we do nothing here, she'll destroy the FC we know and love once and for all.
There's no way I can send this girl who loves flying into that hell empty-handed.
【Masaya】
I won't send her out there without a solid plan.
【Aoi】
......
【Masaya】
I will protect Asuka. I will find a way...!
I have to!
【Aoi】
...I'll give you a hint, Masaya.
【Masaya】
A hint?
【Aoi】
Listen to what your friends, the people who fought alongside you this whole time, are saying.
【Aoi】
There's no surefire way for you to win, but if you do, I'm sure you'll discover the same idea I did.
【Masaya】
Ms. Kagami...
【Aoi】
Alright... I'll leave you to it, then.
Aoi-san turns and leaves right after she says that.
Only us students are left.
【Masaya】
(Listen to what my friends have been saying...? What's that supposed to mean?)
Is she talking about something they mentioned during our practice sessions?
What could it be...?
【Misaki】
I wonder what she means... Masaya and Asuka have tried everything already, right?
【Shindou】
We had three versus one matches, and she even mastered the polygon attack chain.
【Mashiro】
Plus, they even adapted Ms. Kagami's taboo special move.
【Shion】
You think she means my need for speed is the answer?
【Satouin】
I highly doubt that... At any rate, it seems like we've exhausted every possible option.
【Masaya】
Hm...
What was Aoi-san trying to say?
Think. I need to think...
There has to be something I'm missing...
【Madoka】
It can't end like this. That'd be <i>way</i> too depressing...
【Mashiro】
I wish I could've done more to help...
【Madoka】
You've done a lot, Mashirocchi. Like, everyone learned the importance of proper maintenance thanks to you!
【Mashiro】
Oh, <i>come on!</i> I stopped making that mistake ages ago!
【Misaki】
Yeah right. You were space dancing pretty recently.
【Mashiro】
What?! Et tu, Misaki-senpai?!
【Mashiro】
It's not my fault, okay...? It's easy to forget about turning the balancer back on...
【Masaya】
...Huh?
I stand up.
【Masaya】
Hold on... Repeat that, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Well, you know, if even Misaki-senpai is making fun of me, I have no reason to live.
【Masaya】
This isn't the time for your jokes! Just repeat yourself!
【Mashiro】
U-Um, it's easy to forget about turning the balancer back on...?
【Masaya】
Ah...!
I run over to Asuka.
【Masaya】
Asuka... Asuka!
【Asuka】
Oh, Masaya-san...
Asuka forces a smile onto her face.
【Asuka】
I'm sorry, Masaya-san. I wanted to show everyone how fun FC can be, but I can't even smile right now...
【Masaya】
...It's not your fault, okay? Don't let it get to you.
【Asuka】
No, that's not all, I...
【Masaya】
Hm...?
【Asuka】
...I left Inui-san all alone up there.
【Asuka】
I told myself I wanted to enjoy our time in the sky together, but I started getting scared of her instead...
【Asuka】
I'm a bad person, aren't I? I know you're relying on me, but I'm just cowering in a corner...
【Masaya】
Asuka...!
【Announcer】
Overtime will start in one minute. Asuka Kurashina and Saki Inui must make their way over to the first immediately.
We don't have much time.
And so, I'm left with no other choice.
【Masaya】
Asuka, do you want to go up there and fly alongside Inui?
【Asuka】
I do, but I can't keep up with her...
【Masaya】
You can.
【Asuka】
...Huh?
【Masaya】
And when you do, I'm sure you'll show Inui how fun flying really is as you soar higher and farther than anyone else.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san...
【Masaya】
Hand me your shoes...
【Minori】
The time has finally come! Our two finalists, Saki Inui and Asuka Kurashina, shall clash once more!
【Minori】
Now, allow me to go over the rules that apply to overtime. This will be a five minute match, and the player with the most points at the end wins. In the event of a tie, the battle continues and the first to score will be crowned champion!
【Minori】
Skywalkers, please proceed to the starting point.
Inui and Asuka line up beside each other.
【Irina】
Oh my, you didn't run away. I suppose I should commend your courage.
【Masaya】
......
【Irina】
No response? Hehehe... Well, I can understand why you're not in the mood to talk.
【Irina】
Feel free to save your breath for when you have to wail in grief.
【Saki】
...I'll go all out right from the start.
【Saki】
...I won't show you any mercy.
【Asuka】
......
【Saki】
You're upset...? What am I saying, of course you are.
【Saki】
That's why I said... we can't be friends.
【Asuka】
...No, I'm not upset. Actually, I feel bad about how I reacted earlier.
【Saki】
Huh...?
【Asuka】
I won't leave you alone again. I'll come join you in the sky.
【Saki】
What are you saying...?
【Asuka】
I'll fly alongside you, and then we'll become friends.
【Irina】
What?!
【Saki】
Ah...!
Contrails start shooting out right at the starting line.
They're being formed at unimaginable speeds, and are completely different from how they were during regulation.
【Masaya】
Okay, you're off to a good start, Asu--
Shit!
【Asuka】
Eeek!
She seemed to be doing fine, but Asuka suddenly loses her balance and plummets into the water.
And after that happens, waves flow in every direction as a fog begins to shroud the water's surface.
The white screen, which looks a lot like smoke from a fire, spreads out from Asuka's point of impact.
【Masaya】
Asuka! Are you alright?!
Man, maybe this is a bad idea. It's almost impossible for a person to keep their balance in this state...
【Irina】
Well, I was startled for a moment there, but it seems like her Grav Shoes merely malfunctioned.
【Saki】
...Wrong.
【Irina】
Huh...?
【Saki】
That's...!
【Irina】
Light is flowing out... from her Grav Shoes?!
【Saki】
So... huge...
【Asuka】
I'm fine, Masaya-san...
【Asuka】
In fact, I'm feeling better than ever!
【Masaya】
Good... Now, let's show them what we've got!
【Asuka】
Sounds good!
Asuka says that, then launches herself off the water's surface. Her explosive start makes even more massive waves roll out from all around her.
【Saki】
She's so fast...!
【Irina】
No way... This can't be!
After a moment, she quickly overtakes Inui, who's been flying way ahead of her toward second.
【Asuka】
I can't believe it... These shoes are amazing!
【Asuka】
I never knew they had this much hidden potential left!
Asuka's body twists and turns as it advances in zigzags.
In this moment, she's free of gravity, inertia, and everything else...
Asuka's truly become one with the sky.
【Asuka】
This is so fuuuuuun!
Asuka's the picture of happiness as she reaches second.
She made that look almost too easy.
【Irina】
I can't believe it... Normal Grav Shoes aren't anywhere near good enough to match the Agravains in their second form...
【Masaya】
...Yeah, you're right.
【Irina】
And yet you made it possible... How exactly did you modify those shoes?! What did you do?!
【Masaya】
Nothing, really.
【Irina】
You're lying! There's no way that's true!
【Masaya】
But it is... I haven't done anything special. That's my answer.
【Irina】
...Huh?
【Misaki】
Whoa, there are two fish swimming through the sky...
【Mashiro】
It really does look like that, right?
【Madoka】
How nice... That looks fun.
【Misaki】
Man, who would've thought cutting the balancer would take Asuka to the next level.
【Mashiro】
Yeah, I doubt anyone would think restoring the Grav Shoes' default settings is the right answer.
【Madoka】
In a way, you're our hero, Mashirocchi.
【Rika】
Shindou-senpai.
【Shindou】
What is it?
【Rika】
I just want to confirm something... It wouldn't work the same for us if we followed in her footsteps, right?
【Shindou】
Well, Ichinose-kun, do you think you could swim like a fish when thrown into water for the first time?
【Rika】
I knew this was insane...
【Shindou】
I've never heard of anyone seriously flying with their balancer switched off. That's usually reserved for things like tests of courage.
【Shion】
Yeah, same.
【Shindou】
And yet, they're trying it for the first time in the final match of a major tournament... It's only natural that Ms. Kagami was against it.
【Satouin】
What in the world is happening there before our eyes?
【Shindou】
...A good question. I don't know what to say, but I can at least tell that this is no longer the FC we're used to.
【Misaki】
It's not the FC we know...
【Mashiro】
Asuka-senpai's doing something that crazy...
【Shirase】
Oh, it's me, hi. So, the thing is, there's a girl flying with the balancer off in the grand finals over here.
【Shirase】
No, I'm serious. Listen, you need to issue warnings to keep kids from trying this at ho--
【Shirase】
Hello? Hellooo?! Damn it, my signal's bad!
【Shirase】
...Man, this is nuts.
【Shirase】
You know, this might end up changing FC in a different way, Aoi.
【Aoi】
...There's nothing wrong with that.
【Aoi】
Masaya and I aren't fundamentalists. As long as it's fun, it's cool.
【Aoi】
I guess things are going to get a lot busier from here on out.
【Aoi】
People will free themselves from the restrictions of balancers, and we'll see the dawn of a new FC.
【Aoi】
It'll be an era where every single person seeks out the true joy of flying.
【Asuka】
Got it!
Asuka just sped down the second line like a wriggling fish and effortlessly claimed third.
【Irina】
Saki... can't even compete...?
【Irina】
No way... This can't be happening!
Asuka isn't following my instructions at all at this point.
Instead, she's just trying out whatever feels the most fun.
【Saki】
......
And her opponent is just watching her.
She seems confused by the sight, but also quite entranced.
【Asuka】
Saki-chan!
Asuka suddenly shouts out her name.
For whatever reason, she's just waiting by third as she beckons her over.
【Asuka】
What's wrong? Hurry up and join me, Saki-chan!
【Saki】
Ah...!
【Asuka】
This is the most fun thing in the world! Right now, we're flying more freely than anyone else ever has!
【Saki】
......
【Asuka】
Let's enjoy it together!
【Saki】
Ugh...!
【Saki】
Okay...!
【Irina】
S-Saki...?!
【Irina】
Wh-What are you doing, Saki?
【Saki】
I'll... be right over!
【Irina】
Saki...!
【Madoka】
I know this might sound crazy, but...
【Mashiro】
What?
【Madoka】
...I can't help but think they're having a ball up there.
【Rika】
Yeah...
【Misaki】
Yeah, I know what you mean. That looks <i>super</i> fun!
【Shindou】
They were fighting to keep the current, fun FC from changing, but in the process, they changed it in a different way, huh?
【Shindou】
It's more fun than ever now. How very fitting.
【Asuka】
Come on, over here!
【Saki】
I... I won't lose!
【Asuka】
Eek! You got me!
【Asuka】
Alright, then how about this?!
【Saki】
Eek!
【Asuka】
Ahaha! Hahaha...!
Right now, they sound just like a pair of kids who are splashing each other with water at the beach.
Inui... no, Saki and Asuka's battle is frighteningly innocent, yet also extremely advanced.
【Asuka】
All riiight, can you keep up?
Asuka starts flying about in random directions, and eventually, her flight path forms a sphere of sorts.
【Saki】
I'll follow you... anywhere!
Saki, in turn, simply chases after her back.
The two girls form a colorful ball as their contrails mix and mingle in the sky.
【Misaki】
Whoa, what the hell is that?
【Mashiro】
It's like there's a ball floating in the sky...
By this point, Asuka's red and Saki's green have blended together.
And the mixture of those two colors has created a majestic yellow sphere that shines like the sun.
【Minori】
Uh, what...? What in the world... is that?
Hosaka mutters into the mic in an utterly dumbfounded voice.
It doesn't seem like anyone can understand what's happening.
【Shirase】
Is this...
【Shirase】
It's an evolved form of the Angelic Halo, isn't it?
【Aoi】
No, this isn't a simple FC maneuver. Plus, even if it was, you shouldn't lump it in with that thing.
【Shirase】
Aoi...
【Aoi】
The Angelic Halo was designed to lock up and dominate an opponent in a one-sided fashion.
【Aoi】
But this is completely different... It represents the future of FC. They're surpassing the idea of simply competing with each other and showing us something completely new.
【Aoi】
It feels like a huge weight has finally been lifted off my shoulders...
【Shirase】
That's great...
【Shirase】
I'm glad you're free... It's been so long since you pulled away from FC.
【Aoi】
I wonder what Masaya's thinking right now...
【Masaya】
Wow...
What else can I say?
This is nothing like the FC I know.
But that doesn't mean I'm frustrated or sad like when I watched the summer tournament grand finals...
【Masaya】
Actually...
...I can hardly contain my excitement.
I tightly grip the hem of my shirt to help keep my cool.
【Irina】
How... hideous.
【Irina】
They're single-mindedly chasing after each other to the point where they've created a ball of their contrails... That's so...
【Masaya】
Hm?
【Irina】
......
【Irina】
...It's so very exciting.
【Masaya】
Right...
I nod, then turn back to the sky.
There, I see the two of them chasing after each others' backs with smiles on their faces.
They've built a paradise of their own up there, in a space no one else can reach.
【Irina】
Sister... Is this what you were trying to tell me?
Irina's words are drowned out by the wind that comes blowing in from the east.
For a while, I thought this spectacle that was free from all ambitions, rules, and burdens would last forever.
However, every banquet must eventually come to an end.
They're currently tied at 9:9.
Their fun game of cat and mouse, which is a first of its kind, has failed to show who the better Skywalker is yet.
【Minori】
Oh... Um...
【Minori】
Th-This match has taken such a surprising turn that I forgot to keep commentating!
【Minori】
Both players are now tied at 9:9 with one minute of overtime remaining!
【Minori】
After this one minute, the player who scores first will be the winner!
【Minori】
Which player will come out on top in this otherworldly match?! We will soon find out!
Hosaka's announcement reminds everyone that the match will end soon.
Asuka stops moving and positions herself before Saki.
【Asuka】
Haaah... Only a minute left, huh? Time flew by...
Inui has likewise stopped in front of Asuka.
【Saki】
...Asuka Kurashina.
【Asuka】
Just Asuka is fine, Saki-chan.
【Saki】
Okay... Asuka.
【Asuka】
What is it?
I wonder what she wants...
【Saki】
...Asuka, there is someone who is very dear to me.
She firmly grasps her braid as she says that.
【Saki】
I want to win this match for her.
【Saki】
She's the only one who supported me when I could barely speak any English and communicate with people.
【Saki】
She's the one who granted me, who only ever wanted to fly, such wonderful wings...
Saki's eyes are fixated on her braid.
I can't really tell why.
But I assume it has something to do with a memory those two share.
【Saki】
Thank you, Irina.
【Irina】
Saki...!
【Saki】
I'll give this match everything I have for her sake.... I'm going to defeat you, Asuka.
【Asuka】
...I understand.
【Asuka】
I also have someone very dear to me.
【Asuka】
...And I'm going to win for him!
【Asuka】
Haaah... This is the end, so it's a good time as any.
Asuka places her hand on her hair clip.
Then, she closes her eyes and starts to pray.
【Asuka】
I'm finally going to use the one free wish I've treasured for so long...
【Asuka】
I want to win. And not only for myself, but Masaya-san as well... Please, lend me your strength.
I have no idea where she is now, but...
I also send out a silent prayer to the girl who's Asuka's inspiration.
【Masaya】
It's gonna be fine, Asuka.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san...?
【Masaya】
She promised to come help when you wish on that hair clip, right?
【Asuka】
Yes... That's right.
【Masaya】
Well, that means you've got nothing to worry about. Remember, you're not alone up there.
【Masaya】
You, me, and her... There are three of us up there. And when we're together, nobody can stand in our way.
【Asuka】
......
【Asuka】
...Right!
【Asuka】
Masaya-san, I'm ready.
【Masaya】
Okay... Let's do this!
【Asuka】
Yeah!
Asuka and Saki face each other.
Amidst this incredibly tense atmosphere, Asuka, Saki, Irina, and I are all filled with a sense of exhilaration.
This isn't really about winning or losing anymore. We just want to feel the sense of fulfillment that comes with accomplishing our goals.
Now, we have to throw these emotions at each other and see who comes out on top.
【Irina】
Go!
【Saki】
...Okay!
【Masaya】
Hurry!
【Asuka】
Roger!
Our words and emotions intertwine and intersect.
Within the sphere of light, everything collides in this violent genesis of our new FC world.
【Saki】
Ah...!
【Asuka】
Haaah...!
Their showdown ends in mere moments.
Asuka dodges Saki, who comes in from above, with a backflip.
Having had anticipated that, Saki gives chase, but Asuka proceeds to twist her body to shift her flight path by 45 degrees.
That's...!
It's the move I showed her just once!
【Saki】
I can't believe she dodged that...
【Asuka】
Got you, Saki-chan!
【Saki】
Ugh...!
We did it...
Our long battle has finally come to an end.
【Irina】
That final move... It used to be a specialty of yours back when you were still competing...
【Irina】
I see...
【Irina】
We... I never once came close to surpassing you.
【Irina】
I have lost...
【Minori】
Point for Asuka Kurashinaaaaaaaaa!
Thunderous applause erupts from the crowd after that.
【Misaki】
She did iiiiiiiiit!
【Mashiro】
She won! She won! Asuka-senpai won!
【Shion】
Oooh, oooh, oooooooooooooooh...! Congrats, Kurashina!
【Madoka】
Yaaaaaaaaay! Asuka-chaaan! I'm so happy for youuu!
【Satouin】
Asuka Kurashina is quite remarkable. What an unbelievable outcome...
【Rika】
Yeah, she was amazing... Wait, huh? Shindou-senpai, you're leaving already? What about the awards ceremony?
【Shindou】
Watching those two has me feeling a bit frustrated...
【Rika】
Huh...?
【Shindou】
I'm heading over to practice at Takafuji.
【Satouin】
I-I shall assist you, President!
【Rika】
Y-Yeah, me too...!
【Shindou】
Haha! I appreciate it.
【Shindou】
...Hinata-kun.
【Shindou】
You're up next. I will be... waiting for you.
【Announcer】
It's time to award the trophy. The winner of this year's fall tournament is Asuka Kurashina, a sophomore from Kunahama Academy.
【Shirase】
Oh, there she is. Wow, Asuka seems more nervous than before the match... Damn, she almost dropped the trophy. Is she okay?
【Aoi】
Congrats, Kurashina... And you as well, Masaya.
【Shirase】
Why not tell them directly?
【Aoi】
It's embarrassing. Plus, it's not really my style.
【Aoi】
Besides, I've got a ton of work on my plate because of that crazy match.
【Shirase】
Same here. My phone's been ringing nonstop. Asuka-chan'll probably end up an international sensation after that match.
【Aoi】
Knowing her, she probably couldn't care less about that.
【Shirase】
...True.
【Aoi】
Enough talking, let's go. We're the adults here, so it's our job to go take care of all the problems so those kids can fly freely.
【Shirase】
Right, you can count on me.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san!
【Masaya】
Whoa...!
Asuka leaps into my arms as soon as the ceremony ends.
【Asuka】
Did you see what I did at the end? Did you see it?!
【Masaya】
Of course. You did great up there. I can't believe you pulled it off after only seeing it once...
【Asuka】
Thanks...!
【Asuka】
My backflip and your move...
【Masaya】
Yeah, they became one at the perfect moment.
She used every single thing she knew in that battle.
Asuka's simply incredible.
【Irina】
Hinata-san.
【Masaya】
...Irina-san.
Saki and Irina walk over to us.
【Irina】
That was a brilliant display. There was nothing we could do to counter your plan at that point.
【Masaya】
It was purely luck. We just went with our last resort because we got desperate.
Flying with the balancer off was the dumbest idea imaginable.
It was more like a gamble than a plan.
I bet on Asuka pulling off a miracle, and she came through. Nothing more, nothing less.
【Irina】
Still, you emerged victorious in the end.
【Irina】
I was obsessed with strategy and technology, but you used your trust in each other to defeat us.
【Irina】
...That is what made the difference.
【Masaya】
You're probably right.
Our trust never wavered, and it never will.
That's the leg up we have over everyone else.
【Irina】
However, at the end of the day, my feelings about FC haven't changed.
【Irina】
One day... I will show you true FC.
【Masaya】
Bring it on.
【Irina】
However...
A smile forms on Irina's face.
【Irina】
...I feel like I've finally started to understand why you're so obsessed with the idea of FC being fun.
【Irina】
So next time, we'll face you with something different.
【Irina】
Isn't that right, Saki?
【Saki】
...Mhm.
【Irina】
Well then, we shall take our leave. Excuse us.
Irina and Saki turn their backs to us.
And when I look past them, I see their helicopter nearby.
It's kicking up sand as they walk toward it, getting further and further away from us.
【Asuka】
Saki-chan!
Asuka stops Saki.
【Saki】
...Huh?!
【Asuka】
Let's do what we talked about earlier tomorrow!
【Saki】
T-Tomorrow...?!
【Asuka】
I told you I wanted to be friends, right?
【Saki】
Huh...? B-But, um, I have practice...
【Irina】
Saki.
【Saki】
Irina... Can I?
【Irina】
Yes, of course.
【Saki】
Ah...!
【Saki】
Okay... I'll come to pick you up...!
【Asuka】
It's a promise!
This time, they actually leave.
Their helicopter takes off and disappears into the horizon.
However, I feel a lot better about that right now.
We've shared the same sky, so I no longer feel this sense of dread when I see or hear them.
【Asuka】
They're gone...
【Masaya】
Yeah...
【Asuka】
By the way, Masaya-san.
Asuka turns to face me as she says that.
【Asuka】
Do you still remember our promise?
【Masaya】
...Yeah, of course.
She's talking about the promise we made during our first night together.
We decided to share our hidden desires after the tournament.
I have something I want to say to her, and she's in the same boat.
【Asuka】
How should we do this? Do we talk at the same time?
【Masaya】
Yeah, let's do it on three.
【Asuka】
Okay. Here goes nothing! One, two, three!
Asuka counts up, then...
@delete
【Asuka/Masaya】
Huh...?!<T 0>\\nAh...!
【Asuka】
Have a match with me!
【Masaya】
Have a match with me!
【Asuka】
Huh...?!
【Masaya】
Ah...!
No way... This is crazy...
We stare at each other for a bit, then burst out into laughter.
【Asuka】
Haha! Ahahaha, we wanted the same thing!
【Masaya】
Hahaha! Well, I didn't expect that!
After we tire ourselves out from laughing, we face each other once more.
@delete
【Asuka】
Okay... How about next Saturday?
【Masaya】
Sounds good. As for the place... Well, let's just meet up in the sky!
【Asuka】
Yes...!
I can't wait...
【Misaki】
Asukaaaaaa, congraaaaaats!
Misaki suddenly dashes over to us and glomps Asuka.
【Asuka】
Wh-Whoa, Misaki-chan!
【Mashiro】
Congratulations, Asuka-senpai!
【Madoka】
Waaah... Asuka-chaaan, my tears won't stop flowing!
【Shion】
Ohhhhhhhhh! Same here, Kurashina!
【Asuka】
Mashiro-chan, Madoka-chan, Prez...!
【Misaki】
Aight, our next stop is the nationals.
【Mashiro】
Why don't we take a break first?
【Misaki】
'Cause I bet Asuka wants to get back to flying right away.
【Asuka】
That's right. I can't wait!
【Misaki】
Knew it.
【Mashiro】
I guess Asuka-senpai's secret weapon really is her love for FC.
【Shion】
Yeah... You know, now that all the stress is gone, I'm <i>really</i> hungry.
【Mashiro】
Oh, same here.
【Asuka】
I'm also hungry!
【Misaki】
Aight, let's get this party started!
【Mashiro】
Mom said we can have the whole restaurant for the day!
【Madoka】
Waaah... Udon... Udooon!
【Misaki】
Madokaaa! Stick to either crying <i>or</i> talking!
【Masaya】
All three of you did great out there.
Our win finally sinks in when I see the beaming smiles on everyone's faces.
As a whole, the Kunahama FC Club did amazing at the fall tournament.
Mashiro reached the second round.
Misaki reached the third round.
And Asuka reached the grand finals, then brought home the gold.
The curtain has finally fallen on our long, hard journey to the fall tournament.
【Masaya】
She should be here soon...
I check my watch and notice it's almost time.
We could've just met up at Asuka's place, but...
【Masaya】
Wouldn't wanna give too much away before our match...
【Asuka】
Hehe. I knew it!
Asuka walks up to me as she gives me that reply. Guess she overheard me.
【Masaya】
Good morning, Asuka.
【Asuka】
Good morning, Masaya-kun.
【Asuka】
You have some new Grav Shoes, right?
【Masaya】
Yeah. Hien type 1. I asked for a bunch of customizations, so I was worried they wouldn't get here in time.
After I say that, I do a quick spin on the spot.
【Masaya】
But as you can see, I'm good to go. Shirase-san never disappoints.
【Asuka】
Grav Shoes really do look great on you...
【Masaya】
You think?
【Asuka】
Yes, you look cool... Really, <i>really</i> cool.
Asuka's face turns grave soon after.
【Asuka】
Well then... is it time to fulfill our promise?
【Masaya】
Yep. We'll go for 20 minutes, dogfights only.
【Asuka】
There's no fixed field, and the one who has the most points at the end wins.
【Masaya】
It'll be our very own grand finals.
【Asuka】
Yes, let's begin... Master!
【Masaya】
Th-That's kinda throwing me for a loop...
【Asuka】
Oh, okay... I'll just stick to what I usually use.
【Asuka】
Ahem...
【Asuka】
Let's begin, Coach!
【Masaya】
Yeah, let's go!
【Shirase】
...They're starting now, huh?
【Aoi】
Yeah, sure seems like it.
【Shirase】
I can't believe he's flying with the balancer off from the get-go... Masaya's one reckless idiot.
【Aoi】
I guess he doesn't want to be outdone by Kurashina... Then again, I doubt either of them care about winning or losing this match.
【Shirase】
Right.
【Aoi】
Alright... I'll be on my way.
【Shirase】
Wait, what? Aren't you going to watch this?
【Aoi】
Like I said, the outcome is irrelevant. I just want to hear their thoughts after the fact...
【Aoi】
...I'll have them tell me all about it overseas.
【Shirase】
Huh? Hold on, you don't mean...?
【Aoi】
I submitted a leave of absence request already. Given my age, I don't have much time left, so I'll have to work myself to the bone.
【Aoi】
So yeah, take care of all the prep for me, Hayato.
【Shirase】
Wh-What are you talking about?! Isn't this a bit sudden?!
【Shirase】
I mean, what am I supposed to do about my store? I can't just shut it down for a few years!
【Aoi】
Can't Minamo hold down the fort? Or wait, maybe you can leave it in Aoyagi's hands.
【Shirase】
Quit acting like it's no big deal! Heeey! Wait!
【Asuka】
Masaya-kun!
【Masaya】
What is it, Asuka? Do you surrender?
【Asuka】
No, that's not it...
【Asuka】
I'm having so much fun right now!
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
Mhm... Glad to hear it.
【Masaya】
I'm also having a ball!
【Asuka】
Great!
The morning sun is getting brighter, which makes Asuka's face glisten.
This brings me back to the very first time I flew alongside Asuka.
Back then, I was looking up at the sky, but my feelings were a lot more pessimistic.
I thought I had said farewell for good. I thought I would never truly soar through the sky again.
But I'm different now. Everything has changed.
And I'm glad.
【Masaya】
I love you, Asuka!
I shout those words into the clear blue sky.
My voice is loud and firm. It couldn't be more different from the day I quit FC.
【Asuka】
I love you too. Soaring through the sky I love by your side...
【Asuka】
...fills my heart with joy!
【Minori】
I'm reporting live from the Flying Circus World Championship in Long Beach, New York!
【Minori】
I have to say, America is quite an amazing place. I'm getting overwhelmed by all the sights!
【Misaki】
Oh wow, she's over in America.
【Mashiro】
Apparently she tricked some bigshot producer. Told them she was a famous reporter in Japan who's known for her beauty.
【Madoka】
That's <i>crazy.</i> I can't believe that was enough to get them to pay for her travel expenses.
【Minori】
We have ten minutes before the start of the match, so let's take this chance to get to know our competitors a little better!
【Misaki】
Guess we'll finally get to see Masaya and Asuka.
【Mashiro】
I can't wait to hear what they have to say.
【Madoka】
...I've got a bad feeling about this.
【Masaya】
Hey, Asuka, it's almost time.
【Asuka】
Comiiing!
【Masaya】
I see you're full of energy.
【Asuka】
Of course I am! I had a <i>huge</i> dinner last night!
【Asuka】
You went to bed pretty early, didn't you?
【Masaya】
Yeah... I think the jet lag got to me.
【Asuka】
I see... Oh, I know how to fix that...
Asuka walks right up to me after saying that.
【Asuka】
Mmmph...
【Masaya】
Whoa...
She just gave me a kiss on the cheek.
【Asuka】
How was that...? Did it help?
【Masaya】
You know...
【Asuka】
Yes?
【Masaya】
You're getting more bold by the day...
【Asuka】
Th-Th-Th-Th-That's not...
【Asuka】
That's not true... I think.
【Masaya】
So you <i>do</i> know you're changing.
【Masaya】
Huh...? Who's that?
【Asuka】
Ms. Kagami, maybe?
【Masaya】
She's already at the ref's post. Said she wanted to talk to the other player about... Oh!
【Asuka】
Huh? Are you sure it's fine to ignore that call?
【Masaya】
...Yeah, it was just the usual call from <i>her.</i>
【Asuka】
Oh... Haha, I see.
【Masaya】
Anyway, that aside, are you ready, Asuka?
【Asuka】
I got a <i>really</i> tough opponent right in the first round, huh?
【Masaya】
America's representative, Palin... Goes without saying, but he's playing with his balancer off.
【Asuka】
It's going to be alright... I even made sure to pray earlier.
【Masaya】
Oh, you brought that Mr. Robot you talked about?
【Asuka】
Yeah... And I made sure no one saw it.
【Masaya】
Why don't you show it to me?
【Asuka】
N-No, I can't! It's embarrassing...
【Masaya】
Come on, what's the big deal? Show me.
【Asuka】
Hm... Okay, maybe just for a bit...
【Masaya】
Nice. Well, let's just do it after the World Championship.
【Masaya】
Okay, we need to get going.
【Asuka】
Roger!
【Masaya】
Whoa, wh-what's this?!
【Asuka】
A television crew?
【Minori】
Okay, it's time to put our Japan representatives on the hot seat!
【Asuka】
Whoa, M-Minori-chan?!
【Masaya】
What are <i>you</i> doing here?
【Minori】
Hehe... I go wherever my journalist spirit takes me, even it means crossing oceans!
【Minori】
So, let's start off with a question for you, Asuka Kurashina! What makes you and Hinata-san such a great team? Is it because of mutual feelings of trust?
【Asuka】
Yes, of course!
【Minori】
And do those feelings extend to love?!
【Asuka】
Y-Yes... That's right, I love him very... Eek!
【Masaya】
Why are you answering that question, Asuka? And you, Hosaka, should just stop. Quit trying to pry.
【Minori】
Hehe... Sorry, I couldn't reign in my curiosity.
【Masaya】
This is supposed to be a FC focused interview, remember? Let's start from the top with more professional questions, okay?
【Minori】
U-Um, Hinata-san...
【Masaya】
What?
【Minori】
This is a live broadcast.
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
...You serious?
【Minori】
Absolutely.
【Masaya】
Does that mean people in Japan can see this?
【Minori】
Yes! It's Television Nagasaki's first time broadcasting an FC event.
【Masaya】
Oh... Ah... Uhhh...
【Asuka】
M-Masaya-kun...?
【Masaya】
Uh... Craaaaaap!
【Minori】
W-Whoa, Hinata-san, calm down! Wait, cameraman! Quick, film the sky. The sky, I said!
【Misaki】
...What an epic fail.
【Mashiro】
...Oh boy.
【Madoka】
...Kunahama's gonna be the laughingstock of Nagasaki.
【Misaki】
Is it a single channel network?
【Mashiro】
No, all of Kyushu's channels belong to them.
【Madoka】
Haha, yeah, cool... If anyone asks, I don't know them.
【Misaki】
Ahaha, well, I'm just glad they're happy...
【Mashiro】
Right... Ahahahaha...
【Madoka】
Wow, look at how stiff their smiles are...
【Irina】
Hm, he just isn't picking up his phone.
【Saki】
Masaya Hinata?
【Irina】
Yes. I keep asking him to make a comeback, but...
【Irina】
Well, he isn't responding at all.
【Saki】
...I feel like your method is the problem.
【Irina】
Do you now? Still, I feel a forceful approach is the right option.
【Saki】
Hehe...
【Irina】
You're smiling quite a lot these days.
【Saki】
Huh...?
【Irina】
It's all thanks to Asuka-san... right?
【Saki】
...Mhm.
【Irina】
The first round should start any minute now.
【Saki】
I wish her the best...
【Irina】
As do I. I can't wait to see how she develops. It may not be long before she's made a name for herself internationally.
【Saki】
Mhm...
【Irina】
Asuka Kurashina is quite an odd Skywalker...
【Irina】
Her opponents don't seem to mind losing to her. Instead, all it does is excite them. They want to play against her more.
【Irina】
It's a very strange, <i>extremely</i> exhilarating phenomenon.
【Saki】
Mhm... mhm...
【Irina】
Alright, let's get back to practice. We must defeat those two in the next tournament.
【Irina】
Ready, Saki?
【Saki】
Yes, Irina.
【Saki】
...FLY!
Positions, feelings, and the times change.
However, no matter where you are in the world, the sky always remains the same.
When you look up, it's always there waiting for you, looking the same as ever.
【Masaya】
Okay, Asuka, we're pulling out all the stops right away!
【Asuka】
Roger, Masaya-kun!
And that's why I want to travel as far as I can alongside the person who believes in me.
I want to reach the very end of this blue sky together.

Asuka Route -- End.
