I close my fingers, then raise my hands.
With that done, I push my left leg forward to take the first step, then move my right one back to kick off the ground.
After that, I shift my center of gravity just a little forward to get ready to assume a forward-leaning posture as soon as I take off.
Next, I take a deep breath.
And I slowly repeat that process several times as I imagine the sight of oxygen flowing through my body.
The wind direction has changed. There's now a light tailwind stroking my neck.
Finally, I open my closed eyes and prepare to shout the most important word to me.
"Fly!"
【Madoka】
Heeey, Hinata-kun, Hinata-kuuun!
【Madoka】
You sleeping? Hey! Wake up, Coach!
【Masaya】
Hm...? Oh!
【Masaya】
Haaah... Sorry. Is practice already over?
【Madoka】
No, not yet. She's just started doing Low Yo-Yos.
【Masaya】
I see. Sorry for falling asleep.
【Madoka】
You don't have to apologize. I'm just glad you're okay. Don't you think you're working a bit too hard nowadays? I know you're the president, but you can still relax a little.
【Masaya】
Nah, I'm fine, I swear. I just didn't get enough sleep.
【Madoka】
And I'm saying not getting enough sleep <i>is</i> the problem. God.
【Madoka】
...You've been staying up late to work on strategies for Asuka-chan, right?
【Masaya】
...Well, yeah.
I've been doing that every day after practice. It's almost second nature now.
I draft up strategies on the whiteboard, then after getting home, I try them out myself.
I've been trying to keep it on the down low, but I guess Madoka's caught on.
【Masaya】
Don't tell Asuka. She'll start worrying.
【Madoka】
I get that, but... what good will it do if you collapse from exhaustion?
【Masaya】
Hm, you've got a point there... Okay, I'll be more careful. Now, let's go check up on them.
【Madoka】
Heeey! It <i>totally</i> sounds like you weren't even listening to me!
A few days after the summer tournament, we have a meeting to decide our goals for the fall tournament.
@delete
【Masaya】
Okay, go ahead, Ms. Kagami.
【Aoi】
Well, I see everyone's here.
【Everyone】
Yes!
【Asuka】
Yes!
【Misaki】
Yes!
【Mashiro】
Yes!
【Shion】
Yes!
【Aoi】
Good. That means we should start the meeting... younger Aoyagi.
【Madoka】
Yes!
【Aoi】
Proceed according to the agenda.
【Madoka】
Understood!
【Madoka】
Um, so the first item on the agenda is the election of a club president.
In most sports clubs, seniors retire after the summer tournament, since they have to focus on graduating.
Now that the tournament is over, a new president has to be chosen from among the sophomores.
【Madoka】
As you have all already been notified, Masaya Hinata will assume the post. Does anyone present have any objections?
【Misaki】
Nooope!
【Asuka】
I'm all for it!
【Mashiro】
There's no one better for the job.
The election of our new club president takes only a few seconds.
Well, when you consider the current distribution of roles, I'm really the only choice.
【Masaya】
Oh, but let's not change the way you address me. We'll keep calling Prez Prez, too.
【Shion】
Fair enough. We have two Aoyagi's here, so that'd work best.
He has a point, but more than anything, calling him "Shion-san" just doesn't feel right.
Prez suits him best.
【Mashiro】
We ended up picking someone without an actual election at all, huh?
【Masaya】
What, you wanna run?
【Mashiro】
Me as the president...
【Masaya】
...Uh, actually, forget it. That'd spell disaster for us.
【Mashiro】
Hey! Why do you have to be so rude?!
【Aoi】
Come on, that's enough. We've got more important things to discuss.
【Mashiro】
Rogeeer!
【Masaya】
G-Got it.
...Right.
Me becoming the new president is small potatoes.
【Aoi】
Now that the summer tournament is over, we need to start practicing for the fall tournament.
【Aoi】
And in order to do that properly, we need clear-cut goals. Masaya, do you have any in mind?
【Masaya】
Of course.
I stand up and face everyone.
【Masaya】
Our goal for the summer tournament was finishing in the top eight, which we just barely missed...
I point at the tournament bracket sheet that's up on the whiteboard.
【Masaya】
Way I see it, part of the reason for that is the bad luck we had.
【Masaya】
In other words, we were definitely good enough to finish much higher. That being the case, I want to set getting top four as our goal. Thoughts?
【Madoka】
Okay, let's start with Misaki.
【Misaki】
Huh? Why am I first?
【Madoka】
Because you met my eyes first... Hey! There's no point looking to the side now!
【Masaya】
Misaki, just give up already.
【Misaki】
Uh, okay, sure.
【Misaki】
Um, I think top four's a good enough goal. Next time, we can aim a little bit higher.
【Masaya】
Huh, didn't expect you to sound so beat.
【Misaki】
Hm, I mean, it's kinda hard to stay motivated after what we saw at the summer tournament...
...Yeah, I <i>totally</i> get where she's coming from.
Shindou-san, who seemed unbeatable to us, got demolished. I can't blame her for feeling a little gun-shy after that.
【Madoka】
Okay, you're up next, Mashirocchi.
【Mashiro】
I-I... um, agree with Misaki-senpai, I guess.
【Masaya】
You can voice <i>your own</i> opinion, you know?
【Mashiro】
Well, it's supposed to be our club's goal, not a personal one, right?
I guess that's true. Plus, Mashiro isn't really in the same league as the top players right now, so it's hard to ask her for more.
Still, it wouldn't kill her to be a little more motivated.
【Masaya】
Alright, you go next, Prez.
【Madoka】
Ex-Prez.
【Shion】
No! I'm still the president at heart!
【Masaya】
Um, anyway, what do you think, Prez?
【Shion】
We need to win the whole thing, of course!
【Shion】
...Or so I'd like to say, but based on how the summer tournament went, top four in the fall tournament seems reasonable. We can aim for the top next summer instead.
Good job, Prez. You've given the most realistic take so far.
Before I move to the last person, I pause for a moment and take a deep breath.
【Masaya】
Last but not least, what are your thoughts, Asuka?
【Asuka】
Yes, I...
Asuka pauses for a moment as if she's gathering her resolve.
【Asuka】
I want to beat Inui-san.
【Masaya】
...I see.
I was trying to confirm if she still felt the same as she did the day after the summer tournament.
Seems she hasn't wavered one bit.
【Aoi】
Interesting. That'll be tough.
【Asuka】
Yes, but I still want to try it.
【Misaki】
Man, you're nuts, Asuka. Can't believe you wanna take on someone that good.
【Asuka】
Well, I'm sure I'll have to work ridiculously hard to do that, but it feels like it'd be worth it...
【Mashiro】
I can't even find the motivation to just practice, so that's <i>really</i> impressive.
【Masaya】
Yeah, maybe you should work on that.
【Misaki】
Well, even if you crash and burn, you've still got next year's summer tournament.
【Aoi】
What'd you just say, Tobisawa?
【Misaki】
Huh? Just that she's got next year's summer tournament too... What, am I wrong?
【Aoi】
No, that would normally be the case. However, that doesn't apply to Saki Inui.
【Mashiro】
Why not?
【Aoi】
She's going international.
【Misaki】
International...!
【Asuka】
Oh...!
【Aoi】
Inui will most likely leave Japan and aim for the top spot in the FC world if she sweeps the fall tournament.
【Madoka】
B-But that's just your guess, right?
【Aoi】
Do you really think a Skywalker would stay another year after dominating two tournaments in a row? I doubt it. Especially because she's from overseas already.
Makes sense.
I asked Aoi-san and Shirase-san to look into Kairyou Academy right after the summer tournament.
They couldn't find much, but they did learn that the Avalon Group, an international Grav Shoes manufacturer, is involved in management.
In other words, Kairyou Academy is just a front for an international corporation.
Her playstyle overturns all the existing concepts of FC, and she's backed by a giant company. Add those together, and it's clear that Japan is just Inui-san's starting point.
That's why I'm sure Aoi-san's right on the money.
【Aoi】
You've all seen how good she is. If you face her with a half-baked approach, she'll crush you.
【Shion】
What are we supposed to do, then?
【Aoi】
The new president will explain that. Right, Masaya?
【Masaya】
Yeah.
I take in everyone's faces.
【Masaya】
If we wanna beat Inui, I'll have to mainly focus on training a single player.
【Misaki】
Just one player?
【Mashiro】
You mean the one who has the best chance to win?
【Aoi】
That's right. Someone with the necessary skill, talent, and will to win.
【Madoka】
Training everyone equally won't work?
【Aoi】
If we had until the next summer tournament, then maybe. But that's not an option, and the fall tournament is approaching fast.
【Misaki】
In that case...
Misaki speaks up.
【Misaki】
Asuka's your best bet.
【Masaya】
Misaki.
【Misaki】
I mean, she's the only one who reached the third round. Plus, she's the one who actually wants to beat Inui.
【Asuka】
Misaki-chan...
【Madoka】
Misaki, are you sure that's fine?
【Misaki】
Yep!
【Mashiro】
I-If Misaki-senpai is fine with that, then so am I...
【Madoka】
I have a question, Ms. Kagami.
【Aoi】
Shoot.
【Madoka】
Is it really a good idea to just focus on Asuka-chan?
【Madoka】
Wouldn't it be smarter to try to finish in the top four?
【Aoi】
I'm sure you can reach that high with little effort.
【Madoka】
What...?!
【Misaki】
You serious?
【Aoi】
Honestly, Shindou and Inui were in a league of their own during the summer tournament. Defeating them was impossible.
【Aoi】
But now, Shindou can't compete in the fall tournament, which means at least one of our players should reach the top four.
【Mashiro】
But first place is a long shot right now?
【Aoi】
Exactly. It goes without saying that you need to be extremely skilled to win, but other than that, we need someone with the right goal and proper motivation.
And the only player we have that meets all those conditions is Asuka.
【Aoi】
That's why we have a decision to make right now. We either turn our backs and allow Inui to win, or try to take her down. The former should be pretty simple, but the latter is the hardest road imaginable.
【Madoka】
Practice'll be tougher than ever if we decide to challenge her, huh?
【Aoi】
It will. So, what do you say? We can put it to a vote if that's what you prefer.
I run my eyes over everyone's faces.
However, no one seems to be objecting at all.
【Asuka】
U-Um... Are you sure I'm the right choice?
Asuka asks us that in a bewildered tone.
【Masaya】
Everyone here's decided to back you, so the decision is yours.
【Asuka】
Yes... That's true, but...
This is clearly what she wants, but it seems she's worried about having to live up to everyone's expectations.
【Aoi】
Kurashina.
【Asuka】
Y-Yes!
【Aoi】
Have you ever heard about the older Aoyagi's dream?
【Asuka】
Huh? Prez's dream? No.
【Aoi】
You heard her. Time to speak up, Aoyagi.
【Shion】
What...? For real? It's kind of embarrassing to talk about...
【Aoi】
Doesn't matter. She needs to hear it.
【Shion】
Okay... Um, err, you see, I've always wanted the Kunahama FC Club to become the regional champions.
【Asuka】
Oh...!
【Misaki】
Wooow...!
【Mashiro】
Whoa...!
【Masaya】
I didn't know that, Prez...
【Shion】
Well, it's something I thought of even before the club officially existed. Got laughed at a lot for thinking too far ahead back then...
【Aoi】
...But now, that dream just might come true.
Aoi-san smiles at Asuka as she says that.
【Aoi】
Unfortunately, he has to retire already, but you still have a chance to fulfill his dream before he graduates.
【Asuka】
All I have to do is win the fall tournament!
【Aoi】
Right. It's something that has to happen now. We can't wait until the next summer tournament.
【Asuka】
...Alright.
Asuka shifts her gaze between Prez and Aoi-san.
【Asuka】
I'm going to do it!
Then, she makes that bold declaration.
【Shion】
Kurashina... Thank you. I really appreciate the thought.
【Madoka】
Oh, <i>come on.</i> It sounds like you don't believe she can do it!
【Shion】
Ohhh! Right! Kurashina, I believe in you!
【Asuka】
Ahaha... Thank you. I'll do everything I can!
【Aoi】
It's decided, then.
With that, Aoi-san gets up.
【Aoi】
Okay, from now on, the Kunahama FC Club will focus on training Kurashina for the fall tournament.
【Aoi】
...That's all for today.
...And that's what happened. Explains why I'm mainly focused on Asuka, right?
I mean, I'm obviously still working with Misaki and Mashiro, but I'm paying a lot less attention to them at the moment.
Which honestly feels a little wrong. I know we made the decision as a team, but I can't help but question if that was really the right choice.
【Masaya】
Looking good, Asuka.
【Asuka】
Thanks!
【Masaya】
Don't you get tired of doing the same thing every single day?
Asuka shakes her head in response to my question.
【Asuka】
No, not one bit.
【Asuka】
Repeating the same thing is getting me used to flying, which feels great.
【Masaya】
I see. Glad to hear it.
Right now, I'm just having Asuka repeat the basics.
It's basically just field flying, High Yo-Yos and Low Yo-Yos for her. I'm making her go over all the same things that total newbies practice.
In baseball, that would be running. In soccer, it would be juggling.
It's probably pretty frustrating that she has to practice like this after competing in a tournament.
But despite that, Asuka never voices a single complaint.
That's pretty damn surprising, and also a bit encouraging.
【Asuka】
Alright, I'll get back to flying now!
【Masaya】
Wait, are you sure you don't need a break?
【Asuka】
Don't worry! Madoka-chan's making sure I don't overwork myself.
【Madoka】
Yeah, you're still good to go. You've only got another 30 minutes in you, though.
【Asuka】
Roger! Alright, then. FLY!
Asuka's body goes up almost vertically after she aligns her legs.
Her form keeps her from hitting any air resistance. It's so good that it could be a textbook example.
【Madoka】
Wow, Asuka-chan's gotten a lot better already.
【Masaya】
Yeah...
【Madoka】
In the beginning, even an amateur would've called her clumsy, but she's improved a ton.
She's right. And that's why I keep making her run basic drills.
Asuka managed to win two matches thanks to her extraordinary intuition and reflexes.
But we also couldn't employ very many strategies because her actual technique was fairly limited.
That's why I'm having her practice the basics and master them before moving on. But...
【Masaya】
She's improving faster than expected...
【Madoka】
Yep!
The two of us stand there, captivated by the sight of Asuka soaring through the sky.
Her growth is pretty astonishing.
Misaki had the best form in our club less than a week ago, but Asuka has somehow caught up already.
【Mashiro】
Amazing...
Seems there's another member who's just as stunned as us.
【Mashiro】
Haaah...
Her eyes are fixated on Asuka.
【Masaya】
Mashiro...?
【Mashiro】
Huh?!
【Mashiro】
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What?! Look, I admit that Asuka-senpai looks <i>really</i> pretty when she's flying, but I haven't cheated on Misaki-senpai or anything!
【Masaya】
...Thanks for clearing that up.
She went straight to that without me even mentioning it, which makes me think she has a guilty conscience.
【Mashiro】
She really is amazing...
【Masaya】
Yeah.
Mashiro's usually pretty cynical, but her words seem to be filled with genuine admiration right now.
【Mashiro】
I'm kind of jealous... It looks like she's having a lot of fun.
【Masaya】
Does it really?
【Mashiro】
Yeah. She's just doing the same thing over and over, but it looks like she loves every moment.
【Mashiro】
Watching her makes me wonder how fun it would be if I could fly like her...
【Masaya】
Then why not just do it?
【Mashiro】
Huh?
【Masaya】
I may be focusing on Asuka, but I still have time to coach you.
【Masaya】
If you wanna fly like her, I can help.
【Mashiro】
......
【Mashiro】
Right... Guess I'll get back to practice, then.
【Masaya】
Sounds good. But first, do a maintenance check on your shoes and make sure everything's fine.
【Mashiro】
Oh! Right.
After the summer tournament, I taught everyone how to maintain their own Grav Shoes to free up some more of my time.
Asuka and Misaki got the hang of it right away, but Mashiro keeps making mistakes... When she even remembers to check them, anyway...
【Mashiro】
Let's see, anti-gravity is attuned for Speeders, there are no issues with the brakes, and there are also no alerts.
【Masaya】
Make sure to turn the balancer on and off.
【Mashiro】
Oh, right, the balancer.
When you tune the anti-gravity of Grav Shoes, you need to reset the balancer.
Forgetful people often miss that step.
...Which results in them floundering around in the air as if they're drowning.
【Mashiro】
Just the other day, I forgot to do that and ended up spinning around a bunch.
【Masaya】
Grav Shoes come with a safety mechanism, but you shouldn't just rely on that.
Things could get real bad if she does...
【Mashiro】
I know that.
【Mashiro】
Time to fly meowt!
Mashiro's body floats up as she climbs in a far more clumsy manner than Asuka.
【Madoka】
She seems a lot more motivated than usual.
【Masaya】
Yeah. Guess Asuka's been a positive influence.
【Madoka】
Maybe... Too bad she's having the opposite effect on a certain someone else...
I give Madoka a curt nod after I hear that.
【Madoka】
Come on, Coach. Do something about her.
【Masaya】
...Yeah, I really should.
I give her another nod and make my way over to the person in question.
【Masaya】
Yo!
I walk up to a girl who's sitting away from where everyone else is practicing.
【Misaki】
What, you here to check on me, Coach?
She casually waves her hand at me, flashes a kind of smile that doesn't suit her, and rises to her feet with an "up we go."
【Masaya】
You aren't done with your basic drills yet.
【Misaki】
Hm, guess you could put it that way.
【Masaya】
How else would I even put it?
【Misaki】
Hahaha. True.
Her laugh sounds totally fake to me.
【Masaya】
...Does it bother you?
【Misaki】
I already said it doesn't, remember?
【Masaya】
Sure, but you seem to have lost all your motivation.
【Misaki】
Really?
【Masaya】
Does the sight of me focusing on Asuka make you unhappy?
【Misaki】
Nah. It's real heartwarming, I swear.
【Masaya】
Misaki.
【Misaki】
God, I know, okay?! It's pretty damn obvious that I'm sulking right now.
【Masaya】
If you understand, then get moving. That'll help you feel better.
【Misaki】
Man, you're a <i>total</i> optimist, huh...? Sorry, that won't work for me.
【Masaya】
...Misaki.
【Misaki】
Asuka's something special. She lost, watched that match where the guy she lost to got dominated, and still hasn't given up.
Misaki mutters that in a quiet tone as she gazes up at Asuka.
【Misaki】
Look, I promise not to worry anyone by skipping practice, so just leave me alone.
She seems unusually serious right now...
There's probably no point talking to her at the moment.
【Masaya】
Got it.
【Misaki】
'Kay, guess I'll get back to practice... Ready furr liftoff!
Misaki shouts out her activation key in a cheerful tone and shoots straight up into the air.
【Misaki】
You there! Asukaaa! Quit having fun on your own!
【Asuka】
Whoa! You up for a dogfight, Misaki-chan?
Since Asuka is done running most of her basic drills, they decide to move to dogfights.
Despite her attitude, Misaki isn't getting in Asuka's way at all, so I can't really complain.
【Masaya】
Sorry, Misaki.
I honestly feel kinda bad. It almost feels like I betrayed Misaki.
Before the summer tournament, she was obviously Kunahama's best player.
But I still chose to focus on Asuka instead.
Misaki's pretty sharp, so I'm sure she understands why I chose Asuka.
She must understand what she's lacking right now, and that it would take even more work to develop it than what Asuka's putting in at the moment.
Both of us understood that her path to beating Inui-san was a long and hard one.
And that was why she didn't object or complain when I chose Asuka over her.
【Masaya】
Still, I've gotta clear the air eventually...
Misaki's also extremely talented, so if I don't fix things fast, all her FC skill may go to waste.
【Shion】
Yo, Hinata! I'm done asking about practice matches.
Prez comes running over from the direction of the main school building, looking really proud of himself.
【Masaya】
How'd it go?
A grin forms on his face as he hears me say that.
【Shion】
It went great! Shitou Suisan, Kamidorisha, and Takafuji all accepted.
【Masaya】
Oh, sweet. Thanks.
【Shion】
Why are you thanking me? This is only happening because everyone here's improved thanks to your coaching.
【Shion】
If not for that, they would've totally ignored us!
Kunahama's reputation has definitely skyrocketed after the summer tournament.
We're no longer some club that just barely managed to stay alive. Now, everyone is keeping a close eye on us.
We've even got our pages in some FC fansites.
【Shion】
Tobisawa and Kurashina are both great. If this keeps up, we'll become a powerhouse in no time!
【Masaya】
Well, yeah... I guess.
【Shion】
Why the long face?
【Masaya】
Why even ask? You already know.
Prez scratches his head after hearing my words.
【Shion】
...Well, that's true. I mean, it was pretty shocking.
The grand finals shocked every single veteran Skywalker.
Prez included, of course.
【Shion】
Still, you shouldn't get depressed over that. Otherwise, you might affect the other members.
【Masaya】
...Right. Sorry.
【Shion】
Well, I'm going to do a couple laps in the sky.
I make my way over to the clubroom to store the documents Prez handed me.
On my way there, I see Asuka engaged in a dogfight.
Watching it makes me feel like I've entered a whole new world.
【Rika】
Here I come!
Ichinose tries to enter a climb immediately after saying that.
Her plan is to read Asuka's movements and get behind her with a High Yo-Yo.
【Asuka】
Not on my watch!
But Asuka's reaction time proves to be far faster.
She anticipates Ichinose's play and shifts her posture to dive behind her.
【Rika】
Ugh...!
Ichinose failed to react in time.
And as a result, the loop she was flying becomes unusable. Unable to maintain her trajectory, she adjusts her course.
【Asuka】
Oh, an opening!
And that doesn't escape Asuka.
She uses that short moment where Ichinose exposes her back to close the distance and score.
【Rika】
Eeek!
With that, Asuka's in the lead.
【Rika】
...I'm impressed, Asuka-san.
【Asuka】
Same here. I can hardly keep up with your speed.
【Rika】
Hehe... Okay, let's try something else.
Ichinose flies over to the second line after she says that.
【Rika】
This time, you'll start out at a disadvantageous position. Turn around, and I'll go for your back from behind.
【Asuka】
Whoa, that sounds hard...
【Asuka】
But getting through that should be tons of fun! Okay, let's give it a go!
【Rika】
That's the spirit. Ready, set... go!
【Asuka】
Hm, that wasn't quite right...
【Asuka】
Let's try that again... There!
【Asuka】
Oh, yeah, this is it...
【Asuka】
Okay, one more try should help me remember!
Asuka is practicing all on her own now.
【Rika】
Asuka-san is improving incredibly fast. I'm impressed.
Ichinose says that with a hint of genuine admiration in her voice.
【Rika】
It's hard to believe she only started flying a few months ago.
【Masaya】
I know, right?
【Rika】
It's still a little hard to accept...
Ichinose heaves a sigh while gazing at Asuka with a look of envy.
【Rika】
I'm assuming her goal is beating that girl, right?
【Masaya】
You mean Saki Inui?
Ichinose nods.
【Rika】
I'm no top player, so I don't want to exaggerate, but...
【Rika】
It felt like she was far above any of us.
Ichinose has a grave expression on her face as she says that.
【Rika】
Shindou-senpai was someone that everyone at Takafuji considered untouchable.
【Rika】
He was someone none could hold a candle to. Someone who would never lose.
【Rika】
And yet... she completely shattered that belief.
Ichinose pauses for a moment to take a deep breath after saying that.
【Rika】
It's far harder for us to accept that loss. Understand?
They believed Shindou-san was an unrivaled Skywalker.
It's not hard to get that the Takafuji students who have been by his side this whole time are having a hard time accepting his defeat.
Shindou-san, who always went to the nationals and swept them with ease, lost in a regional tournament. No one would've called that.
It may be true that Shitou players are the best in the country, but that doesn't change that he was the cream of the crop.
【Rika】
Still, there was something that shocked me even more.
【Masaya】
Oh? What?
Ichinose flashes a smile in response to my question.
【Rika】
You can't tell?
【Masaya】
No... Nothing comes to mind.
【Rika】
Asuka-san.
...Oh, I see.
【Rika】
After the final match, I talked to everyone from Kunahama.
【Rika】
Everyone was either depressed or dumbfounded, but Asuka-san seemed... <i>excited.</i>
【Rika】
"Rika-chan, Shindou-san's match was <i>really</i> cool, wasn't it? I want to beat Inui-san!"
【Masaya】
...She said that to you?
【Rika】
Yeah. It was pretty shocking. I never expected to see someone that excited after witnessing that match.
Ichinose has a bit of a distant look in her eyes.
【Rika】
And that's why I want her to succeed. I want her to take revenge for all of us.
Her eyes are those of a fierce predator who's sizing up their prey.
They're looking straight through Asuka, toward the newly crowned champion.
【Rika】
I'm willing to help out anytime, so feel free to use me.
【Masaya】
Thanks. I'm sure you'll be a huge help.
I really mean that.
Currently, Asuka is running basic drills during our club's usual practice time. And after that, she runs through some practical scenarios with other people in the evening.
If we just keep this up, she should perform a lot better in official matches.
【Masaya】
Thing is...
【Rika】
What's wrong?
【Masaya】
It's still kinda hard to say she'll win, since Inui-san's <i>really</i> good.
【Rika】
You have a point... But...
【Masaya】
Hm?
【Rika】
It's hard to put this into words, but there's something about Asuka-chan that makes me believe she can pull it off.
【Masaya】
Huh? Seriously?
【Rika】
I'm sure you understand. Asuka-san's immeasurable talent will <i>definitely</i> lead her to victory.
Fair enough.
Coaching Asuka has given me the feeling that she's got limitless potential. And that belief is growing by the day...
【Rika】
That's why we need to believe in her. Otherwise, there's no way she'll win.
I nod in response to Ichinose's words. And right after that, Asuka lands beside us.
【Asuka】
I'm all done!
【Rika】
Welcome back. How did it go?
【Asuka】
I think I've finally got it! I can enter a steep climb from a dive now!
Asuka proceeds to explain how she figured out each individual step in excruciating detail. Damn, she seems <i>really</i> happy.
Can't believe she's not even a bit nervous when her goal is to beat Saki Inui.
【Rika】
See, Asuka-san can <i>definitely</i> do it.
【Asuka】
Huh? What are you talking about, Rika-chan?
【Rika】
Hehe. It's a secret, right, Hinata-san?
【Masaya】
Y-Yeah...
【Asuka】
Huh...?
【Masaya】
Asuka can definitely do it...
I repeat Ichinose's words as I roll around in bed.
Asuka definitely has a lot of room to grow, and she's a real quick study.
But the problem is, her opponent seems no less talented than her.
I can't quite tell who has the higher ceiling, but it's obvious that Inui-san is better at the moment.
【Masaya】
Guess I've got another sleepless night ahead of me...
I can hear Madoka's worried voice already.
【Masaya】
Haaah...
I get up off my bed and boot up my PC.
Oh, there's a new article on the summer tournament on this fansite.
It's mainly about the defeat of the strongest Skywalker, Kazunari Shindou, and the new champion, Saki Inui. Figures.
The writer doesn't seem to have grasped the true nature of that match. They're just praising how skilled each of the players were.
But by some stroke of luck, they've given Inui-san a nickname that suits her playstyle perfectly.
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
Monarch of the Skies... God, that hurts.
It's been a week since the summer tournament.
And I've spent each and every moment either training Asuka or working on strategies for the fall tournament.
Everyone else has been in pretty low spirits, but Asuka's the polar opposite.
As the coach of the Kunahama FC Club, it's my job to train everyone equally and prepare them to place higher in the fall tournament.
That's <i>definitely</i> what I should be doing.
However, Saki Inui's overwhelming strength placed doubt in my heart.
And not just because of how skilled she was. You see, the way she was challenging the very concept of our FC burned me up inside.
I knew if I just let things be, she'd destroy everything I love about the sport.
And so, I chose to focus on Asuka, the single player who wasn't at all disheartened by Inui-san's display.
Because I'm sure she's the only one that can stand up to that monster.
That's why all I can do is place my faith in her and wait.
But...
I still feel uneasy about that decision.
Was it <i>really</i> the right choice? Am I sure Asuka can win?
Those dark thoughts stew inside my head, giving birth to doubts.
For some reason, my dreams are brimming with hope.
They show me standing tall, facing the sky, looking ready to take off.
They show me the pure joy I felt when I got my first pair of Grav Shoes.
There's a huge gap between the sweet emotions I relish inside my dreams and the anxiety I'm riddled with when I'm awake.
Maybe I'm just having these dreams because I'm trying to escape the ever present sense of dread I feel when I'm training Asuka to beat Saki Inui. Or maybe I'm just trying to use them to find hope.
I'm really not sure what the truth is, but I'm still forced to face reality whenever I'm awake.
And so, all I can do is believe.
Because I know there's only one way for Asuka to overcome that monstrous opponent.
Our only option is to make slow, steady progress to try and close the gap between them.
【Teacher】
...Amidst that chaos, Yoshimitsu Ashikaga became the Grand Chancellor of State, which made him the highest authority among the military and government. Following that--
Summer break is right around the corner, so there are only a handful of classes each day, and school lets out early.
Right now, I'm in Japanese history.
【Masaya】
(What to do...)
I'm trying to figure out how to proceed with Asuka's FC practice.
Inui-san's cold expression and Irina-san's smile remain fresh in my mind.
【Irina】
"You'll understand true FC."
No matter what I try, I just can't shake those words. They left too big of an impression on my mind.
【Masaya】
(Ugh, I need to forget them and focus... We need to make slow, steady progress or she'll never win...)
I drive away those unnecessary thoughts by shaking my head. Then, I wrack my brain for new ideas.
Just need to focus on what's in front of me...
My ears suddenly start to ring. Man, I know I'm confused, but this seems like a little much...
The sound of a helicopter is reverberating inside my head...
【Masaya】
(......)
【Masaya】
(...Hold on, this isn't in my head.)
I look outside the window to spot where the sound's coming from.
And then, I see...
【Teacher】
Yoshimitsu, however, wasn't content with that and tried to claim the throne. And in order to achieve that, he...
【Teacher】
He... Huh?
Our history teacher finally looks out the window.
【Teacher】
...What the hell is that?
The rest of the students follow his gaze upon hearing him say that.
【Male Student A】
Huh?! The hell?!
【Female Student A】
Whoa, why's that thing at our school?
【Male Student B】
Wait, lemme snap a quick pic. That's <i>totally</i> instagramable!
【Teacher】
Hey! Keep it down!
The classroom erupts into a cacophony of noise.
Why's a helicopter landing at our school? This makes <i>zero<i> sense!
【Masaya】
What's this about?
I mean, I'm sure this has nothing to do with me, but...
【Masaya】
Oh!
Hold on, it can't be?! Why are those two here?!
【Masaya】
You've gotta be kidding me.
Two all too familiar individuals are standing out on the sports grounds with the wind from the helicopter whipping against them.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san, that's...!
Asuka calls out to me in a surprised tone. Guess I'm not just imagining things.
【Masaya】
Yeah...
Saki Inui and Irina Avalon.
There's no way I'd forget the people we're training to defeat.
【Asuka】
Why are they here?
【Masaya】
I've got no clue... Though, it's safe to assume it has something to do with us.
They must be practicing for nationals right now.
So why the detour?
【Misaki】
Man, they're <i>really</i> putting on a show, huh? Wonder what they want...
【Madoka】
They have to have brought that helicopter for a reason...
The two of them exchange a few words while we watch and speculate.
A couple men in black suits come out of the helicopter and surround them. It seems like they're waiting for someone.
【Asuka】
Oh, some teachers are out there now.
It doesn't take long for some teachers to go up to them and start a conversation.
A few moments later, the teachers nod several times, then start calling someone. They're probably just phoning the faculty room, I guess.
【School Broadcast】
This is Kageyama from the Student Council. Um, the teaching staff is currently speaking to the passengers about the emergency landing, and...
They're trying to cover everything up by claiming it was an emergency landing?
【Male Student A】
Oh, it was just an emergency landing?
【Female Student A】
Man, I though some VIPs came by to visit.
...Well, that's not totally off base.
【Misaki】
...That's a pretty lame cover story.
【Asuka】
At least it'll keep people from panicking.
【Madoka】
Yeah, and I doubt anyone other than us would even notice they're lying.
Everyone seems to be calming down now, so whatever works.
【School Broadcast】
Um, since Ms. Kagami is dealing with the situation, there will be no homeroom for class 2-C today. Students are to head home right after classes end.
【Masaya】
(Yep. This <i>totally</i> has to do with us.)
The two teachers down there could've dealt with an emergency landing on their own.
Aoi-san's involvement must mean it's FC related.
【School Broadcast】
Also, Masaya Hinata from class 2-C is to come to the faculty room after school. That's Masaya Hinata from class 2-C.
【Asuka】
Oh!
【Misaki】
Figures.
【Madoka】
Knew it.
Same.
Still, I wonder why they're here? It's <i>really</i> hard to figure them out.
【Asuka】
Be careful, Masaya-san.
【Masaya】
Relax. It's not like they're gonna try to kidnap me or anything. I'll go see what they want.
I just hope my guess isn't right, or things could get ugly...
Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure it is.
【Aoi】
...Oh, so that's why you're here.
【Irina】
Yes.
【Aoi】
Hm...
【Aoi】
Irina-san, was it? That's quite a gruesome approach. It doesn't really suit your cute face.
【Irina】
I have question.
【Aoi】
Yeah?
【Irina】
I don't understand "gruesome." Please tell me what it mean.
【Aoi】
I see. You don't know, huh?
【Aoi】
Well, it basically means... ruthless, dirty, or other things along those lines.
【Irina】
Oh, I understand. Ruthless very clear to me. It come up in historic plays.
【Irina】
Oh, but...
【Aoi】
But?
【Irina】
...Weren't you a "gruesome" player when active?
【Aoi】
Oh...?
【Irina】
I still remember clearly. The 3rd round of the 5th world championship.
【Irina】
After reaching third line, you went with play that clip your opponent's wings, knowing it traumatize them.
【Aoi】
...I'm surprised you know that much. So what, you're here to follow in my footsteps?
【Irina】
Oh no, this just greeting. Think of it like cultural exchange.
【Aoi】
Haha! A cultural exchange, huh? You're really something else.
【Irina】
Thank you for compliment.
【Aoi】
And that's all she told me... So, what's the plan?
【Masaya】
...Should be obvious. I can't let Asuka face her yet.
Irina-san proposed something rather simple.
A practice match between Saki Inui and Asuka with the exact same rules as an official match.
I was hoping I was wrong, but it seems my fear wasn't unfounded. She's trying to break her opponents' spirit in advance.
Squashing the bud before it blooms, essentially.
【Aoi】
Yeah, I'd normally be worried about a player losing their motivation, but--
【Aoi】
Masaya, did you see the look on her face during the grand finals?
【Masaya】
...Of course.
【Aoi】
I see. That's good.
【Aoi】
I've been involved with FC for a long time, but that was the first time I saw a player look like that in such a depressing situation.
【Aoi】
Chills ran down my spine when I saw it.
【Masaya】
...Same here.
【Aoi】
Haha. Figured as much.
She laughs a bit before composing herself.
【Aoi】
She gets more excited based on the strength of her opponent. And that's the number one thing you need to become a top Skywalker.
【Aoi】
I'm convinced that won't change even if she loses this practice match.
【Masaya】
Right, but...
Aoi-san's expression turns stern when she sees me hesitate.
【Aoi】
I get that you're worried about her, but she still has a lot to learn. And the best way for her to gain experience is to face strong opponents.
【Aoi】
She'll have to face Inui eventually, so why not start now? That's the way you should be seeing this.
I know she's right.
If Inui-san is in tournament shape, the difference in skill between them will be massive.
But confirming that gap will only help Asuka grow.
Because once we know exactly what separates them, we'll learn how to best prepare for the fall tournament. And that's what we need most at the moment.
【Masaya】
...Right. This is a great opportunity.
【Aoi】
Glad you agree. Well, I'll let them know we accept.
【Masaya】
Thanks.
I bow before moving toward the door, but then stop and turn to face her again.
Something still feels off about all this.
【Masaya】
Gotta say, this feels <i>really</i> weird.
【Aoi】
What do you mean?
【Masaya】
You're not usually the type to just go along with someone else's plans.
【Aoi】
Yeah?
【Masaya】
You used to say that the fight begins long before the start of the match, right?
She used to drill that idea into my skull.
In other words, she was saying that preparation is half the battle.
If your opponent gets into your head and you go into a match with a negative mindset, you're starting off with a handicap.
That's why I'm surprised she's readily agreeing to something that may give them the upper hand.
【Aoi】
Well, I do kind of want to watch Kurashina fight Inui.
【Aoi】
Besides, it's not like I just agreed to everything. I'll have you know that I shot down her first suggestion right away.
【Masaya】
Oh? What'd she want?
【Aoi】
It's not happening, so don't worry about it... Anyway, go prepare for the match now.
【Masaya】
Got it. What are you gonna do?
She doesn't normally come to watch us practice.
【Aoi】
I'll watch from a distance and come over if things go south.
【Masaya】
Oh, okay! Cool...
【Aoi】
You don't have to look all surprised. I'm your club advisor, so that's my job.
She's right, but it <i>is</i> unusual for her to be this involved.
Guess it just means Inui-san is that special...
【Irina】
Long time, no see, Hinata-san.
【Masaya】
...Yeah.
It's been 30 minutes since my meeting with Aoi-san. Seems the stage is almost set now.
【Irina】
I wholeheartedly thank you for agreeing to practice match despite short notice.
【Irina】
Kairyou Academy doesn't interact with other schools, so this our only option. Thank you for being kind enough to play along.
【Masaya】
Care to tell me what you're after?
【Irina】
What I'm after...? You mean with this match?
【Masaya】
Of course.
For whatever reason, they prioritized this practice match over prepping for the nationals.
And I want to know why.
【Irina】
Um...
【Irina】
Oh, yes, it to help Saki improve. That's right.
【Masaya】
......
【Irina】
Saki's technical skill still insufficient. And also, she's lacking experience. That's why--
【Masaya】
...Fine. Let's just leave it at that.
【Irina】
O-Oh, okay...?
【Masaya】
Excuse me. I'm going to go get ready now.
【Irina】
Of course. I'm looking forward to match.
【Irina】
...I can't wait.
【Misaki】
...What'd she say?
【Masaya】
She just dodged around the question, so I'm not sure what they really want.
【Madoka】
Makes sense.
【Mashiro】
Are you sure Asuka-senpai will be okay?
【Masaya】
I get why you're worried, but just trust her a little, okay?
【Asuka】
I get to fight Inui-san...! I get to face the person who beat Shindou-san...!
【Asuka】
I'm <i>soooooo</i> excited!
【Asuka】
Alright, I need to pump up my fighting spirit...! Spirit! Spirit! Spirit!
【Masaya】
...See?
【Misaki】
She's kinda sounding like Prez out there.
【Mashiro】
She seems nervous <i>and</i> happy at the same time...
【Madoka】
Do you have some sort of plan?
【Masaya】
Yeah, I've got an idea already. Just need to discuss it with Asuka.
This isn't a regular practice match.
We have to register as a threat on their radar, or this whole thing'll be pointless.
Now that Asuka's fundamentals have vastly improved, she can put up a good fight. She <i>definitely</i> won't do as well as Shindou-san, but it's still a little soon for that, so I've got no room to complain.
Our only goal here is to do well enough to make them remember us.
Once our preparations are complete, both players and seconds gather on the beach.
【Shion】
Okay, the practice match between Kairyou Academy and Kunahama Academy will now begin.
【Shion】
The competitors are Saki Inui from Kairyou Academy and Asuka Kurashina from Kunahama. Prepare to get started after you exchange greetings.
The two of them walk over to Prez, who's serving as the referee, and bow to each other.
【Asuka】
Let's have a great match!
【Saki】
...Mhm.
Last time I saw her was during the grand finals.
Her face and voice are just as expressionless as back then.
I wonder if that poker face is a part of her strategy, or just how she normally is...
【Saki】
......
【Masaya】
Huh?
For a moment, I thought Inui-san was staring straight at me... Guess it was just my imagination.
When I turn to look at her, she walks over toward Irina-san.
【Asuka】
Wow, she has this <i>really</i> special aura around her!
Asuka is gazing at Inui-san, visibly excited.
【Masaya】
Listen up, Asuka. We're going with the plan I explained earlier, so don't you dare let her take control of the match.
【Asuka】
You want me to play just like before, right?
【Masaya】
You got it.
I told Asuka to just play like before, with a focus on basic techniques.
【Asuka】
Um, so that means...
【Masaya】
There's no chance of you beating Inui-san in a race, since she beat Prez and all.
【Asuka】
In that case, I need to jump to the second line and...
【Masaya】
You're an All-Rounder. If you can just read and react to her movements in time, keeping up with her should be easy.
All-Rounders usually follow a playstyle like Satouin-san's. They focus on canceling out the strengths of their opponent while trying to also exploit their weaknesses.
However, Asuka's a rare breed of player. She has these mysterious flashes of insight that allow her to pull off unimaginable things.
That's why we need her to remain close to her opponent for as long as possible. That way, she may think of some way to pull out a win.
The more opportunities she has, the more things Asuka can try out.
During the summer tournament, Inui-san would've just shaken her and that would've been the end of their match.
But she's improved leaps and bounds since then, so I'm sure she can keep up.
In other words, this strategy revolves around getting close to Inui-san and throwing things at the wall until something sticks.
【Masaya】
Start by jumping to the next line. After that, I want you to recall your match with Shindou-san and play the same way. Stick as close to her as you can. If you see a chance, block her path and--
I start to go over our strategy in more detail, but then I notice that Asuka's face has clouded over.
【Masaya】
Asuka?
【Asuka】
Oh, yes!
【Masaya】
Lost in thought? You should <i>really</i> be paying attention right now...
【Asuka】
Oh, no, I wasn't lost in thought. I was listening, I swear. It's just, um...
...What's wrong?
Does she not understand something or what?
【Masaya】
If there's something you don't get, I can go over it again.
【Asuka】
No, it's fine... I understand everything.
【Asuka】
...It's just that I'm feeling a little nervous.
【Masaya】
Oh, yeah, I can imagine.
Who wouldn't be when they're playing against such a unique and skilled Skywalker?
Still, I'm a little surprised she's scared when she seemed so excited a moment ago.
Guess that just goes to show how much pressure Inui-san exerts.
【Masaya】
All you can do now is try. We have all the time in the world to think things through after this match, okay?
@delete
【Asuka】
Got it!
Oh, she sounds all excited again. Guess I helped kill her nerves.
【Shion】
Is everyone ready?
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Irina】
We good to go.
【Shion】
Alright, then position yourself at first.
【Masaya】
Break a leg, Asuka.
【Asuka】
Will do!
Asuka and Inui-san fly over to first.
Once they're there, Asuka looks over to her opponent with inquisitive eyes.
【Asuka】
I'm glad I get to face you.
【Saki】
Likewise.
I pick up Inui's monotonous voice through the headset.
Seeing that both players are now ready, Prez nods lightly and raises the whistle to his lips.
【Shion】
Ready, set...!
【Masaya】
Here we go...
I gulp down my saliva and focus on the match.
Inui-san jets off toward the second buoy with a Low Yo-Yo as soon as the whistle resounds.
Asuka, on the other hand, jumps to the second line. Good, she's following the plan so far.
【Misaki】
This is all pretty standard... Wouldn't it have been better to follow her to try and throw her off her game?
【Mashiro】
Yeah... Wait, Inui-san is crazy fast!
【Misaki】
Huh? Oh, yeah! She hasn't always been that fast, right?
【Madoka】
I think she's faster than when she fought my brother...
【Mashiro】
M-Masaya-senpai!
I cover the mic to keep Asuka from overhearing our conversation.
【Masaya】
She's always been this fast, so calm down. You'll spook Asuka if you freak out around me.
【Mashiro】
O-Oh, okay...
I did consider the strategy Misaki just suggested, but I opted to go for a more simple playstyle.
That idea may come in handy eventually, but it <i>definitely</i> doesn't suit Asuka right now.
I bring the mic to my mouth.
【Masaya】
Asuka, relax and take a couple deep breaths once you're in position on the second line. Inui-san should reach you real quick, but don't let that fluster you.
【Asuka】
Roger!
A few moments later, I hear Asuka breathing in and out.
She's currently circling a quarter of the way down the second line.
【Saki】
......
Inui-san touches second, which nets her the first point of the match.
【Masaya】
...What?
【Asuka】
Huh?
Inui-san suddenly disappears.
【Asuka】
Coach! Where'd Inui-san go?!
【Masaya】
Look up. She's <i>really</i> high above second.
A 90 degrees quick-turn? Is that some sort of Airkick Turn?
Guess the details don't matter much now.
It's clear she wants a match just like her one with Shindou-san.
【Saki】
......
She's looking down on Asuka from high above.
【Irina】
Very well executed, Saki. Now, move to "Bird Cage" as planned.
I know I'm not supposed to eavesdrop, but Irina-san's so close that her instructions just happen to enter my ears.
Bird cage...? What's that supposed to mean?
【Asuka】
Coach, what should I do?
【Masaya】
Relax. She only took the high ground. Don't lose your cool.
Hopefully that's enough to ease her mind... Hm, what could Inui be up to?
She's just floating several meters above second.
Asuka jumped lines, so she can't go for third until she either touches Inui or crosses her path.
The score's sitting at 0:1.
If this keeps up, Inui will win by default.
Kinda feels like Misaki and Ichinose's match all over again...
There's no good reason for a Skywalker who's in the lead to break a stalemate.
And that means we have to make the first move.
...I see. That's why she called it "Bird Cage," huh? They're trying to trap Inui's opponent in a no-win scenario.
【Saki】
......
【Asuka】
......
Time flows by as the two of them continue to stare straight at each other.
What should we do?
I'm sure she's already prepared for a dogfight.
I want to drag Inui down with a surprising approach, but I can't think of anything that'd be effective...
【Asuka】
Coach?
【Masaya】
Have you loosened up enough?
【Asuka】
Y-Yeah. I'm good to go.
【Masaya】
This is pretty risky, but it's all we've got.
【Asuka】
R-Roger!
【Masaya】
Fly toward second.
【Asuka】
Not Inui-san?
【Masaya】
Yep. She's above second, so that'll count as you crossing paths. Once you're near it, react accordingly.
【Masaya】
If Inui doesn't make a move, touch the buoy and shoot toward third.
【Asuka】
But she'll definitely try something, right?
【Masaya】
Yeah. And when she does, do an Airkick Turn and speed away in the opposite direction. I'll give you a signal. You can pull that off, right?
【Asuka】
Yes, I can! Alright... Here I go!
Asuka proceeds to fly toward second.
【Saki】
......
When will Inui swoop down?
I'm sure she plans on using gravity to accelerate, but Asuka can turn faster than Inui can even react at the moment.
【Saki】
......
Inui's body slides down smoothly.
The motion feels so natural that it reminds me of a pile of snow slipping off a slanted roof. It's hard to even tell when it began.
【Masaya】
Now!
【Asuka】
Roger!
Asuka tucks in her arms and legs, then kicks the air to instantly change the direction she's flying.
Did I give her that signal too late?
She's flying straight down the line, which is the shortest path to the buoy, but that might not be enough to beat Inui.
Everything'll work out great if she manages to touch third, but it'll still be fine if she fails. After all, closing in on Inui is our main goal here.
This is going down to the wire...
【Masaya】
Try to touch her if you don't think you'll reach the buoy first. Doesn't matter where.
When you're facing an opponent with great form, throwing them off balance is key.
【Masaya】
Do whatever it takes to drag her into a dogfight.
【Asuka】
Roger!
【Saki】
......
The distance between them closes.
Unfortunately, Inui's nearing third a lot faster than I imagined.
Should've known...
Oh well, this match has only just begun. Can't get down in the dumps over one little battle for the second line.
【Saki】
......
She's about to touch third, so...
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Asuka】
Huh?
Contrary to my expectations, Inui spins around in front of the buoy and faces Asuka.
Wait, what? She's going for a dogfight even though she's already at the buoy?
What the hell are they doing...?! Ugh, whatever, can't panic now. I need to guide Asuka before she's a goner.
【Masaya】
Remember, just try to touch her. Doesn't matter where.
【Asuka】
Roger!
【Saki】
......
Inui deflects Asuka's outstretched hand downward.
【Asuka】
Ah!
That makes Asuka lose her balance, but she somehow manages to move forward anyway.
【Saki】
......
【Asuka】
Ugh!
Asuka's throwing everything she has at her, but Inui's just parrying each and every attack.
Why does this feel so <i>wrong?</i>
How?
How is Inui managing to stay above Asuka even though she's attacking from a lot of different angles?
Usually, both players move about erratically in dogfights, which means their positions swap constantly.
But here, their positions remain fixed as if it's the most natural thing in the world.
【Saki】
......
【Asuka】
Haaah... Haaah... Haaah... Haaah...
Asuka's starting to get tired.
...I get it now.
Inui keeps repelling Asuka at the same angle. She's managing to stay above her by sending her down each time.
This is bad! Asuka'll be too tired do anything at this rate!
【Masaya】
You need to get away from her. Take a deep breath and fly back toward second.
【Asuka】
R-Roger. Eeek...!
I hear a hint of fear through my headset. That's new.
【Masaya】
I never would've guessed she'd play like this...
I'm honestly shocked.
Inui sticks to Asuka like white on rice.
Whenever Asuka moves right, she moves right. Whenever she goes left, she goes left.
Somehow, Inui seems to be reading all of Asuka's moves perfectly.
【Saki】
......
【Asuka】
Haaah... Haaah... Haaah...!
And she isn't going for Asuka's back, either. Her whole strategy seems to be centered on tiring her opponent out.
Asuka can't stop moving now. If she does, Inui will easily score multiple points.
That's why she's flying around in a desperate attempt to shake her.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san...!
Asuka calls for my help in a troubled tone.
【Masaya】
U-Use feints! Also, move up and down, not just left and right. I'm sure you'll find a chance to escape if you keep that up!
【Asuka】
N-No! That won't work!
【Masaya】
What?!
【Asuka】
No matter where I go... Inui-san is always there.
Seems Asuka knows she has no real options.
Humans tend to make subtle gestures before moving in any way.
For instance, when a person tries to jump up, they push down to help gain momentum.
Inui's most likely reading all those signs to mirror Asuka's movements.
【Asuka】
There's... no way out!
【Masaya】
Ugh!
"Bird cage."
Like the name suggests, they've formed a prison that cuts off movement in every direction. Asuka is trapped.
【Mashiro】
...This is disgusting.
Mashiro practically squeezes out those words, her voice full of blatant disdain.
I get it. She's probably realized the situation Asuka's in, and being unable to move in any direction is pretty damn gross.
【Madoka】
Huh? Can't she just, like, slip out with some cool move? Usually, Asuka-chan would just, you know, swoosh up or down or something.
【Misaki】
Sure, that'd work on any other opponent...
【Madoka】
Oh...
【Misaki】
But Inui's reading Asuka like a book. No matter what she does, there's no chance of her getting away.
I knew Misaki would understand.
Still, I can't just sit back and watch her lose. There has to be something I can do to help!
【Masaya】
Let's try to fake her out, Asuka. Make it seem like you're going for a Low Yo-Yo, but then after you've dropped down, do an Airkick Turn to enter a rapid climb.
【Asuka】
R-Roger!
If this works, Inui will think she's going for a Low Yo-Yo and swoop straight down to try and catch her prey.
Then, all Asuka has to do is exploit that mistake and get away before Inui can change directions.
It's the exact same thing Shindou-san tried to do in the summer tournament.
Back then, there was a fair amount of space between the two of them, which gave Inui time to figure out his plan and counter it by getting above him.
But now...
【Asuka】
......
【Saki】
......
Asuka and Inui are right next to each other. There's no way she can react in time. I'm sure this'll work!
Once Asuka pulls it off, things should be looking up.
It'll help her build some much needed confidence, since this match seems to have worn her down mentally.
And who knows how this match'll turn out after that!
【Asuka】
Ah...!
Asuka shoots down with her arms pressed against her sides. Good, she's pulling this off perfectly. I'm sure they're none the wiser.
Inui responds to that by copying her trajectory.
【Asuka】
Now!
Asuka rockets up with an Airkick Turn!
【Masaya】
Sweet!
Her timing was perfect! Take that, Inui!
【Saki】
...I won't let you escape.
【Asuka】
Oh no!
...All our hope turns to despair.
Inui's descent was fake. She knew <i>exactly</i> what we were going for.
How?!
Sure, Airkick Turns have a pretty long windup, but there's no way she could've reacted that quickly...
She had to have known all along.
But how? How'd they figure out our plan right away?!
【Asuka】
Eeek... Oh no...
In the end, nothing's changed. Their relative positions are the same as before.
【Masaya】
I can't believe it...
I'm dumbfounded by the display of skill Inui is putting on.
【Masaya】
This is nuts...
I was naive. So very naive.
And I only understand that now.
Based on what I saw in the summer tournament, I assumed Inui was still playing standard FC.
Sure, her strategy was unorthodox, but I thought she was still adhering to all of FC's core principles.
But I was <i>way</i> off base.
Inui is trampling our very concept of FC.
To her, this sport isn't even about scoring points. Instead, she's trying to dominate her opponent by controlling the flow of movement in the air.
And nothing about that fits into our current mindset.
It seems the only way to beat Saki Inui is to throw aside all our current FC knowledge.
【Masaya】
So this is the Monarch of the Skies...!
That title seems more fitting than ever right now.
【Irina】
One minute left, Saki.
【Saki】
Understood.
【Irina】
Stay focused until last second. Understand?
【Saki】
Yes, Irina.
I overhear that exchange and begin to grit my teeth.
Is there... Is there <i>really</i> nothing we can do?!
【Masaya】
This is just...
I clench my fists and glare up at Inui.
【Masaya】
This is just a slow, painful death.
Time keeps ticking away. Then, finally--
【Shion】
Th-The match is over!
The final score is 1:0.
She's dominated in a single point victory yet again.
【Saki】
Thank you for the match.
【Asuka】
...No, thank you.
They return to their respective camps after exchanging those pleasantries.
【Masaya】
Asuka...
【Asuka】
......
Asuka's just standing there, her face as pale as a ghost.
【Madoka】
Asuka-chan...
【Mashiro】
Asuka-senpai...
She sits down on one of the chairs we have out, casting her gaze down in an attempt to avoid all the worried glances.
I can't fault her for being all depressed after that loss.
Asuka's been working her ass off lately, so I figured she could at least keep up with Inui. However, the gap between them seems wider than ever now.
I knew she wasn't good enough yet, but I at least wanted to believe Asuka was catching up... How'd everything go so wrong?
【Irina】
That was fantastic!
Those untimely words resound in a cheerful tone. Ugh, talk about bad taste...
【Irina】
It was really great match! Saki learn a lot. Thank you.
【Masaya】
Ugh...!
Is she mocking us?! We were just puppets dancing on her strings...
She planned all this to kill Asuka's motivation, even going as far as to give their strategy that humiliating name, and now she dares to call it a "great match"?!
I should just...
【Masaya】
Look...
Yeah, I'll just chew her out. She <i>definitely</i> deserves it.
But...
【Misaki】
...Cut the bullshit.
【Irina】
Pardon me?
Misaki, who's been silent this whole time, makes her displeasure clear.
【Masaya】
Cool it, Misaki.
【Misaki】
No!
【Misaki】
...Sorry, Masaya. I can't hold back anymore. Just lemme say my piece.
【Irina】
Is there some issue?
Irina-san looks confused.
【Misaki】
You've got some nerve to say that after coming all the way out here to traumatize her!
【Irina】
......
【Misaki】
You just scored one point, then messed around with her the whole time. What the hell was that about?
【Masaya】
Misaki...
I try to stop her, but she's clearly not paying attention to me at all.
【Misaki】
You proud of winning like that?! Must be, since you're going on about it being a "good match" and shit!
【Misaki】
At this rate... Asuka will...
Misaki's voice is rather hoarse.
She's probably frustrated because she understands <i>exactly</i> how Asuka feels.
However...
【Irina】
Misaki Tobisawa.
【Misaki】
...Wh-What?
【Irina】
What else was I supposed to say?
【Misaki】
W-Well...
【Irina】
"That sure was an overwhelming victory for us, wasn't it?" "Wow, you were utterly powerless before us, weren't you?" "I have to say, you played right into our hands." Would you prefer those?
【Irina】
I do feel bad about springing match on you... But that's why I try to end on friendly note.
【Misaki】
Ah...!
Misaki falls silent.
That's probably a good thing. At this point, we'll just sound like sore losers if we keep complaining.
It's not like they cheated or anything, so we've got no leg to stand on.
Besides, I'm sure she's noticed that Irina-san is utterly unfazed by her rant.
【Irina】
...Let me rephrase words.
Irina-san begins speaking in a calm, collected tone.
【Irina】
Hinata-san, I tell you I would show true FC, yes?
【Masaya】
...Yeah.
【Irina】
But to me, it look like you playing different sport.
【Masaya】
Ugh! What'd you just...?
【Irina】
It great fun to watch that different sport, but when we have our next match, I want you to play <i>our</i> FC.
...A different sport.
She isn't wrong. Inui and Asuka were playing in such different ways that it was hard to notice anything similar about them.
However, the way she's saying that makes my blood boil.
【Irina】
Well then, we excuse ourselves now. Saki.
【Saki】
Yes.
【Irina】
Let's go.
【Saki】
Yes, Irina.
They're about to leave, but I can't just let things end like this...
【Masaya】
Hold up, Irina-san.
And so, I calm myself down a little and call out to stop them.
【Irina】
Yes?
【Masaya】
You outplayed us in every way. I'll admit that.
【Irina】
I see. Good.
【Masaya】
And I know we probably just seem like ants to you, but...
【Masaya】
But...
I glare at the two of them as I continue.
【Masaya】
...But we still have our own wings. So watch out, 'cause someday soon we'll fly right up to you and...
【Masaya】
...knock you out of the sky.
【Misaki】
Masaya...
Misaki says my name in a shaky tone after hearing my speech.
I'm sure my speech came off rather aggressive, so that makes sense.
【Irina】
Hehe...
Irina-san, however, merely chuckles lightly and puts on her usual friendly smile.
【Irina】
I knew it.
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Irina】
You... very interesting. Or rather...
【Irina】
...very amusing.
【Masaya】
......
【Irina】
...I look forward to that day. We see you then.
With that, they take their leave.
And no matter how I try to deny it, I know everything went according to their plan.
Eventually, I hear the sound of a helicopter again.
I look over to it and watch as it recedes into the distance.
【Masaya】
We're gonna beat you, I swear it...
I say that while clenching my fists so tight that they hurt.
【Misaki】
......
【Masaya】
......
Seems Misaki's also been staring up at it.
Gotta say, that serious expression on her face <i>definitely</i> doesn't suit her.
【Misaki】
......
【Masaya】
...Hey, Misa--
I want to calm her down, but...
【Misaki】
Aggghhh!
【Masaya】
Whoa!
Misaki lets out a loud scream, which effectively drowns my words out.
【Misaki】
God, what the hell'd I say? Seriously, what's wrong with me?!
【Misaki】
Sorry for jumping the gun and picking a fight, Masaya.
【Masaya】
U-Uhhh...
【Misaki】
I know that was a bit much, but I just couldn't hold it in any longer...
【Misaki】
What should I do? Think I pissed her off? She's rich, so she can <i>definitely</i> afford a couple bombs, yeah? Sure hope she doesn't drop a few on us tomorrow...
【Masaya】
...Haha!
Her rant did seem a little odd, but now it all makes sense.
She did that to keep me from going on a tirade.
She was worried about me endangering my position as the coach. Plus, she knew the sight of me getting angry would hurt Asuka.
She was looking out for the entire club this whole time.
There's no way she would've gotten that emotional otherwise.
【Masaya】
Misaki.
【Misaki】
Yeah?
【Masaya】
...Thanks for being so considerate.
I give her a light pat on the head.
【Misaki】
What?
Then, I walk over to Asuka.
【Masaya】
Asuka.
【Asuka】
......
Asuka is still looking straight down at the ground.
I can't make out her expression right now, but she's obviously depressed.
What should I say to cheer her up?
【Masaya】
Sorry, Asuka. I messed up. That loss is on me.
I frantically search for the right words.
【Masaya】
Why don't you head home and get some rest? We can pick this back up tom--
【Asuka】
...Ugh!
【Masaya】
Asuka?
【Asuka】
I feel <i>soooooooooooooooooo</i> frustrated!
【Masaya】
Huh...?
【Asuka】
How'd that happen?!
【Masaya】
Asuka...
【Asuka】
I can't believe it! She wiped the floor with me!
【Asuka】
I was like a deer in headlights the whole time... Amazing. That was a <i>really</i> useful lesson!
【Asuka】
It's good to know there's someone that incredible out there.
【Asuka】
I'm going to have to work a lot harder to beat her in the fall tournament!
【Asuka】
H-Huh...? Is something wrong, Masaya-san?
【Masaya】
No, um...
I'm so confused.
How can Asuka react like this?
Misaki and I both lashed out at Irina-san because we were frustrated by their actions.
But somehow, Asuka's turned that very same sense of frustration into a positive, motivational factor.
Seriously, she's crazy. I could never do something like that.
【Asuka】
U-Um... Masaya-san?
Which makes me think...
【Masaya】
Asuka.
【Asuka】
Y-Yes!
【Masaya】
...We'll beat them next time.
I extend my hand toward her as I say that.
【Masaya】
You can do it... I know you can!
【Asuka】
Oh...
【Asuka】
Thanks!
Asuka grips my outstretched hand and uses it to pull herself to her feet.
And after that, we just end up gazing into each others' eyes.
【Mashiro】
...Are you two done now?
【Masaya】
Whoa!
【Asuka】
M-Mashiro-chan!
【Mashiro】
Could you please not react like you forgot I was here?
Mashiro clears her throat after she says that.
【Mashiro】
Um, Masaya-senpai. I have a suggestion.
【Masaya】
A suggestion...?
What, is she gonna say we should flirt on our own time?
【Mashiro】
I've talked to Misaki-senpai and--
【Misaki】
Yeah, Mashiro <i>really</i> wants you to stop flirting around her.
【Masaya】
What?!
【Mashiro】
No! That's not it... Well, she's telling the truth, but that's not what I'm trying to say.
...Seriously?
【Mashiro】
You see, um, it's about the fall tournament...
【Mashiro】
We want to help Asuka-senpai. Involve us in her special training!
【Masaya】
H-Huuuh?!
【Asuka】
Really?
That's, um...
That'd <i>definitely</i> give Asuka a leg up.
But it'd also probably hurt their chances of placing high in the fall tournament.
【Masaya】
Well, I'm not gonna say no, but... you sure about this?
【Mashiro】
I mean, I <i>do</i> want to improve and do better at the fall tournament.
【Mashiro】
But honestly, Asuka-senpai's revenge match feels more important.
【Misaki】
Yep. Same here. That's why she's telling you to use us.
【Mashiro】
R-Right... So, what do you say?
【Masaya】
......
I'm amazed by how much they care about Asuka and the rest of the club.
【Masaya】
Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Yeah!
【Masaya】
I'll take you up on that offer. Thanks.
【Mashiro】
Y-You're welcome...
【Masaya】
Same to you, Misaki.
【Misaki】
Mhm... Asuka's repping Kunahama, so we've gotta make sure she doesn't embarrass us out there.
She sounds awfully happy, but I'm sure Misaki's got some conflicting emotions on the matter.
That's why all I can do is respect the courage it took for her to make that decision.
【Asuka】
A-Are you two really, <i>really</i> sure?
【Misaki】
Asukaaaaaa!
【Asuka】
Yes? Whoa!
【Misaki】
You better knock them dead, girl!
【Asuka】
I-I will! I promise I will, s-so stop touching my breasts!
【Misaki】
Oh, you mean these puppies?
【Asuka】
Eeek!
【Mashiro】
Grrr...!
【Masaya】
Oh, <i>come on!</i> I'm not even looking!
...Anyway, I'm just glad it turned out alright.
I mean, sure, that match messed me up real good, but at least Asuka's doing fine.
How can we defeat Inui? How do I even begin to formulate a winning strategy? I've honestly got no clue.
But one thing's for sure, I've got my work cut out for me.
【Masaya】
Still...
【Misaki】
Oh, come on, Asukaaa! No running awaaay!
【Asuka】
N-No, I have to run!
【Mashiro】
Chase me instead, Misaki-senpai!
I get the feeling that everything'll work out in the end.
For whatever reason, gazing at those three makes me think that practice match was a huge help.
【Masaya】
...Okay. I've just gotta get to work.
First, I need rearrange Asuka's training regimen.
And after that, there's a bunch of stuff I need to look into.
【Madoka】
What a relief... I was worried things would go south.
【Shion】
......
【Madoka】
Huh? What's the matter, Shion?
【Shion】
Hic...
【Shion】
Waaaaaaaaaaaah!
【Madoka】
H-Huh?! Shion, why're you crying?! Seriously, calm down!
【Shion】
Listen, Madoka, I'm the luckiest man in the world!
【Madoka】
Huh?
【Shion】
All the members are sharing in the joy, anger, and tears that come with competing in FC... This is the kind of club I've always wanted...
【Madoka】
Shion...
【Shion】
This makes my struggle to keep the club alive worth it!
【Shion】
I have to do everything I can to support them! Yeaaah, I'm burning with energy!
【Madoka】
......
【Madoka】
...I see.
【Madoka】
You've wanted teammates like them for so long.
【Madoka】
But they only showed up in your last year at this school. It's no wonder you're sad.
【Shion】
Ugh... Whyyyyyy!
【Madoka】
Go on, let it all out... Hic... God, now I'm tearing up a little...
【Madoka】
This marks a fresh start for the Kunahama Academy FC Club.
With that, our involvement with Inui and Irina-san ends for the time being.
That said, they're still at the forefront of my mind.
The next day, I change the schedule and decide to start off with an anti-Inui strategy meeting.
【Masaya】
I've called you all out here for one specific reason.
【Misaki】
Wow, how mysterious!
【Mashiro】
I know, right? It almost feels like we're part of some shadowy cabal.
【Madoka】
Does that mean I get to be the sexy secretary?
【Shion】
I'll be the beefcake bodyguard.
【Asuka】
I-Is this what you mean by strategy?
【Masaya】
Guys, cool it.
【Misaki】
Fiiine! You have my ear.
【Mashiro】
Well, I'm <i>all</i> ears.
【Masaya】
Seriously...
【Madoka】
You sure you don't need a sexy secretary?
【Masaya】
Positive!
What happened to the serious atmosphere from yesterday?
...Well, this is still <i>way</i> better than seeing them all depressed, so I can't complain.
【Masaya】
Look, let's just move on.
I'm sure they already know what we're here to discuss.
We need to find a way to overcome Saki Inui's dominant playstyle.
【Masaya】
Way I see it, we should analyze her playstyle and adopt the things that work best.
【Misaki】
Wait, you're saying we should abandon <i>our</i> FC?
【Masaya】
Well, that's just one option.
I turn to face Asuka.
【Masaya】
Asuka.
【Asuka】
Y-Yes. What is it?
【Masaya】
How'd you feel during yesterday's match?
【Masaya】
Can you think of any way to counter her? Give us your honest opinion.
【Asuka】
My honest opinion?
【Madoka】
Of her brand of FC, obviously. Don't go telling us who you have a crush on or anything, you hear?
【Asuka】
M-Madoka-chan?!
【Masaya】
Prez.
【Shion】
Yeah!
【Masaya】
I think it's time for Madoka to logout.
【Shion】
Oh, okay!
【Madoka】
Huh? Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
【Shion】
Time to go for a walk, Madoka.
【Madoka】
Huh?! What're you doing, Shion?! Put me down! Heeey!
【Misaki】
Weird, Madoka's a lot cuter now. Did she finally hit puberty?
【Mashiro】
Yeah, she's <i>way</i> better now. It's just too bad that her skin's blue.
【Madoka】
Oh, <i>come on!</i> There's no way you like that thing more than me! It's just a teddy bear!
【Masaya】
It's good that she's learned to be less silly. I hope Madoka stays like this forever.
【Asuka】
U-Um, I'm starting to feel sorry for her... Can we let her back in?
【Masaya】
Well, if that's what you <i>really</i> want.
【Madoka】
Does what I want not matter?!
【Masaya】
Bingo.
【Madoka】
I can't believe you just said that so quickly!
【Madoka】
Coach, I'm sorry. I'll never do that again, I swear. Please let me back insideee!
【Masaya】
Fine... Prez, unlock the door.
【Shion】
Gotcha.
【Madoka】
Haaah... I-I was ...
【Masaya】
Zip it, or I'll have him take you a lot farther away.
【Madoka】
Eeek! No, please don't...
【Misaki】
I miss teddy bear Madoka already!
【Mashiro】
Same here!
【Madoka】
Guys, that <i>really</i> hurts...
【Masaya】
Okay, that's enough. Let's get back to business.
Thanks to Madoka, we got totally off track. Or maybe it's better to say we changed tracks entirely...
Guess I should ask her again.
【Masaya】
So yeah, Asuka, what'd you notice during the match?
【Asuka】
Well, um, er...
【Asuka】
Honestly, I can't think of anything helpful.
【Masaya】
In other words, you were powerless, right?
【Asuka】
Basically, yeah.
Gotta say, the name "Bird Cage" is <i>totally</i> on point.
I just can't believe they're going with a strategy that revolves around blocking off every possible escape route. That's <i>really</i> hard when both competitors are flying freely through the sky.
【Asuka】
Um, I don't know much about strategy, or well, I have a hard time coming up with my own strategies, but...
【Asuka】
I feel trying to copy her playstyle is a mistake.
【Masaya】
Huh?
I'm surprised she reached that conclusion on her own.
【Asuka】
U-Um, is that a bit of a stretch?
【Masaya】
No, go on.
【Asuka】
Okay... Well, um, it feels like Inui-san has spent a lot of time perfecting her playstyle.
【Asuka】
So I don't think there's enough time for me catch up by copying her.
【Asuka】
Instead, it would be better to figure out what suits me best.
【Asuka】
I-I'm sorry. I know I'm probably wrong here...
【Masaya】
I see...
Asuka's approach is actually the smarter one.
There's nothing wrong with studying Inui's playstyle, but trying to master it in two months is insane.
Compared to that, focusing on what Asuka's already good at and trying to improve it is the much better idea.
【Masaya】
Okay, we'll go with your plan.
【Asuka】
Huh?! Really?
【Masaya】
Yeah, but...
If we go with that plan, we'll have to have her master a unique playstyle.
She'll only ever manage to break through that cage with a Fighter's skills.
She needs to learn to mix calm, rational decisions with her animal instincts and reflexes.
And that's easier said than done. Besides, can she even manage that when her only training partners are the other members of our club?
【Masaya】
With just those three, it'll be... Hold on.
Misaki, Mashiro, and Prez.
I realize something as my gaze wanders over everyone's faces.
Yeah, this could <i>totally</i> work!
【Masaya】
Okay...
Now I've just gotta figure out how to put it into practice.
【Masaya】
Haha...!
【Asuka】
Something wrong, Masaya-san?
【Masaya】
No, it's nothing.
【Masaya】
No, it's just, this is <i>really</i> starting to feel like something straight out of a sports show.
【Asuka】
Huh?
【Misaki】
What, you think of something?
【Mashiro】
Probably something lewd based on that laugh...
【Madoka】
Boss, take a <i>good</i> look at, mhh, these documents here... See, I'm <i>totally</i> the perfect sexy secretary!
【Madoka】
Ouch! Hey, how come I'm the only one who got hit!
【Masaya】
It's 'cause you've been warned already.
【Madoka】
That's no fair.
【Masaya】
Uh, it <i>definitely</i> is. Now quiet, or I'll whip out the teddy bear again.
【Madoka】
A-Anything but that!
【Misaki】
No way, you're saying...
【Mashiro】
...you want us to...
【Shion】
...assault Kurashina at the same time?!
【Masaya】
...Wow, you guys are in sync already. Nice.
Though Prez's part of that line sounds <i>really</i> wrong.
【Masaya】
Listen, just trust me, this is for the best.
I know for a fact that Inui has no blind spots.
And that means she'll turn the tables on attacks from any possible angle.
So, what other options do we have left?
【Masaya】
I can't think of any way to break out of that Bird Cage from yesterday.
Relying on pure speed isn't an option, and every other idea I have seems flimsy at best.
【Masaya】
So, the only thing that comes to mind is to shape Asuka into the perfect weapon for one-on-one scenarios.
【Shion】
In other words, you want her to play like a Fighter?
【Masaya】
Yep.
I start sketching on the whiteboard after confirming that idea.
【Masaya】
Inui's insane reflexes and absurd agility allow her to react to an opponent's movement at a moment's notice.
【Masaya】
Unfortunately, we don't have anyone who can play like her to help Asuka prepare. However...
I add three arrows that are pointing toward the Asuka on the whiteboard.
【Masaya】
If you guys attack her in quick succession, we can create an artificial version of Inui's Bird Cage.
【Masaya】
...So yeah, that's the plan.
【Asuka】
I'm going to fight you all at the same time...
Asuka seems confused by the idea.
Makes sense, since this <i>does</i> seem pretty crazy. Almost makes me wonder if I'm going too far.
But I know I'm not. After all, Inui's playstyle is the most unique thing I've ever encountered.
And so, we need to pull out all the stops to climb to her level.
【Masaya】
Well, what do you guys think?
I glance at everyone's faces.
【Misaki】
What great strategy this. That sure put Saki in bind, yes.
【Masaya】
That's <i>really</i> annoying, Misaki.
Plus, it's a pretty bad impression of Irina-san. Her Japanese is mostly fine.
【Misaki】
I say, I could go for a spot of tea, gents.
【Masaya】
Enough! Don't make me turn you into a teddy bear!
Why the hell is she pulling a Madoka?
【Misaki】
Oh, <i>come on,</i> you can't blame me here. This is starting to feel like something straight out of a sports manga.
【Masaya】
True.
【Mashiro】
But we're going through with that plan anyway, right?
【Masaya】
We are. It's the only way Asuka'll ever beat her.
【Shion】
...Right. We need a monster to beat a monster.
【Madoka】
Oh, you mean we need something like a ghost?
【Misaki】
I dunno, can't say I really wanna kill Asuka...
【Asuka】
Yeah, I don't want to die, either...
【Mashiro】
Don't worry, a ghost is <i>way</i> too weak. We'll probably need an alien!
【Asuka】
H-How would you even turn me into an alien?!
【Masaya】
Seriously, stop! I'll iron out the details later, but it's safe to say you're all in, yeah?
【Shion】
You got it!
【Misaki】
Yessiree, Bob!
【Mashiro】
Roger, Dodger!
【Masaya】
Okay. We'll now commence Operation Ultimate Asuka Kurashina!
【Asuka】
I-I'll do my best to unleash my potential!
【Masaya】
Okay, I'll assign your roles and positions now.
【Misaki/Mashiro/Shion】
Sounds good!\\nGotcha!
【Misaki】
Sounds good!
【Mashiro】
Sounds good!
【Shion】
Gotcha!
Prez and Mashiro are Speeders, while Misaki is a Fighter.
We'll need to find the best way to use their differing skillsets in unison.
【Masaya】
Okay, Misaki.
【Misaki】
Yeah?
Misaki's an extremely agile Fighter.
And that means she's the perfect Inui stand-in. Out of the three of them, she's the one who'll directly confront Asuka.
【Masaya】
Misaki, focus on blocking Asuka's path.
【Misaki】
'Kay. Can do.
【Masaya】
Make sure she hates the sight of you by the end of this.
【Asuka】
Eek!
【Misaki】
Oh? Sounds fun. Heh...
【Asuka】
P-Please go easy on me, Misaki-chan.
【Misaki】
I dunno, maybe I'll just go and spill what I learned during our girls night-- Mgh!
【Asuka】
Nooo! You can't! I won't let you!
Asuka leaps toward Misaki and covers her mouth with her hand.
I wonder what she told them...
【Misaki】
...You just gulped down a big ol' batch of saliva, didn't you?
【Masaya】
Did not. Anyway, that's not what I meant.
【Masaya】
...I'm pretty sure you already knew that, though.
【Misaki】
Heh... Fine.
【Asuka】
Oh...!
Misaki's personality makes her pretty damn unpredictable, but she should still serve as a good challenge for Asuka.
The crucial part comes now.
【Masaya】
Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Y-Yeah.
Mashiro's a Speeder, so she's not really the best at blocking an opponent's path.
Luckily, I can make use of her experience as a Fighter. She should do fine if I just make her support Misaki.
【Masaya】
Can you try to be on the opposite side of Asuka? You know, like, try to sandwich her between you and Misaki.
【Mashiro】
Um, can you elaborate?
【Masaya】
You a good cook?
【Mashiro】
I guess I'm okay... Wait, what does that have to do with anything?
【Masaya】
Um, well... Do you understand the relationship between planets and fixed stars?
【Mashiro】
I mean, I obviously know what stars are, but... what are fixed stars?
...Figured.
Shouldn't have brought up terms like that. They're only really useful when talking to astronomy buffs.
【Masaya】
Okay, forget that term, it's not important. Just imagine Misaki's the sun.
【Misaki】
For real? Sweet! I know I'm hot, but this is something <i>totally</i> new!
【Mashiro】
<i>Of course</i> you're the sun, Misaki-senpai! The whole world revolves around you!
【Masaya】
Listen, I'm not done yet. Asuka's Earth and you're Mars.
【Asuka】
I'm Earth... That's <i>so</i> cool!
【Misaki】
Man, Mashiro kinda got the short end of the stick, huh?
【Mashiro】
How could you! Make me Earth instead!
【Masaya】
Calm down, I'm just giving you an example. Quit lashing out over every little thing.
I swear, none of them have a patient bone in their body.
【Masaya】
You know that all the planets in our solar system have a fixed orbit with the sun as the center, right?
【Mashiro】
Huh...?
Damn it... Guess we'll have to help her study before the next exams.
【Masaya】
I'm saying that they're all following the line of a circle.
【Mashiro】
O-Oh! Now I get it. Okay.
【Masaya】
Good. I want you two to surround Asuka like that. And also...
【Mashiro】
Yeah?
【Masaya】
Asuka'll naturally end up having her back to Mashiro while you're doing that.
【Misaki】
Mhm.
【Asuka】
I'll be focusing on Misaki-chan, so yes.
【Masaya】
Right. That's why I want her to attack you from behind.
【Mashiro】
From behind?
【Misaki】
Wow, Mars is gonna crash straight into Earth.
【Mashiro】
O-Oh no, what are we going to do!
【Masaya】
Forget that example already!
Bringing up that idea was clearly a mistake.
Guess only boys are really into space trivia.
【Masaya】
Listen, Mashiro, just keep a close eye on them, then go for Asuka's back when her guard's down.
【Mashiro】
Got it!
Phew... Glad that's done.
Now, last but not least...
【Shion】
My turn! I'm ready!
Prez is a huge problem.
He's only really good at racing straight toward buoys, so there's not much use for him in dogfight practice.
Let's see, the best way to use him is...
【Masaya】
Prez, I want you to fly up and down near Asuka.
【Shion】
Gotcha. How should I attack her?
【Masaya】
Same as Mashiro. If you see an opening, touch her as you fly by.
【Shion】
Gotcha!
I'm glad Prez doesn't need some long-winded explanation.
Though I bet the conversation would stretch on for hours if I used muscles as an example.
【Masaya】
Well, let's get started. Feel free to take a break if any of you ever get tired.
【Asuka】
U-Understood!
【Misaki】
Yessiree, Bob!
【Mashiro】
Roger, Dodger!
【Shion】
Gotcha!
I turn to Madoka after hearing their replies.
【Masaya】
Madoka.
【Madoka】
What do you need?
【Masaya】
Can you keep an eye on them?
【Madoka】
Sure, you going somewhere?
【Masaya】
Yeah. I've got something I need to confirm.
【Madoka】
Oh?
【Aoi】
I see. You're trying to make her a Fighter leaning All-Rounder.
【Masaya】
...Is that a bad idea?
【Aoi】
No. I probably would've done the same thing in your shoes.
That's a relief.
Hearing her say that fills me with confidence.
【Aoi】
But even if that helps her break out of the Bird Cage, what will she do after that?
【Masaya】
I have something in mind.
【Aoi】
Oh?
【Masaya】
I'm still working out the kinks, though. Think I'll discuss it with Asuka after she graduates from dogfight practice.
【Aoi】
And you won't let me in on your secret until that time comes, huh?
【Masaya】
Right... Sorry about that.
【Aoi】
Don't apologize. You're making the right choice here. There's no point talking to me about it until you have an actual plan.
I know she's trying to encourage me, but I can't help but feel nervous.
I mean, her question is perfectly valid. There's no point breaking out of the Bird Cage if we can't go on the offense after.
I need to solidify my plan as fast as possible.
But to do that, I'll have to wait and see how Asuka grows. Making a plan of attack without taking her skills into account would be silly.
【Aoi】
Well, I'm sure you'll be fine. Just do what you think is best.
【Masaya】
Thanks.
【Aoi】
I'll be there to pull you back if you go too far, so don't hold back. Right now, half-assing it is the worst option.
【Aoi】
There's no way you'll beat those two if you do.
Wow, even Aoi-san seems to hold them in high regard. Just goes to show that Inui and Irina-san are actual threats.
I've gotta work my ass off to beat them...
【Aoi】
Oh, Masaya...
【Masaya】
What's up?
【Aoi】
Is Kurashina getting along with the others?
【Masaya】
Huh? Yeah, of course.
Honestly, it feels like she's the one who's bringing us all together.
I tell Aoi-san as much, even.
【Aoi】
I see... Look, just don't forget about the other members, okay?
【Masaya】
Y-Yeah, that goes without saying.
What's she trying to say?
We're finally all working together with a single goal in mind. And that's made us closer than ever. I <i>really</i> don't see the problem here...
【Masaya】
I'm back... Wait, why are you outside?
【Madoka】
Oh, welcome back. They're changing in there, so I'm keeping watch.
【Masaya】
I see.
This reminds me of the time I accidentally saw them changing...
Yeah... Maybe imagining that's not such a good idea.
【Madoka】
You still owe me, my friend...
【Masaya】
Ugh...
【Madoka】
I have a feeling our relationship'll be a long, fruitful one.
...She still remembers?
【Masaya】
Don't make me log you out again!
【Madoka】
Oh, <i>come on!</i> You owe me two now, so quit being so mean!
【Masaya】
Yeah, yeah... More importantly, how'd practice go?
【Madoka】
Oh, right.
【Madoka】
Boss, mh, I'll give you my report on today's practice mhh...
【Masaya】
Cut that out already.
【Madoka】
Tch... I <i>really</i> liked being a sexy secretary, though.
...She's gotta be kidding.
【Masaya】
Look, just tell me how it went.
Madoka shakes her head, looking rather dejected.
【Madoka】
Well, it was a <i>huge</i> mess. Asuka-chan got mauled the whole time. She couldn't do anything.
【Masaya】
...Figured.
It would've been pretty scary if she was doing well on her first try.
Though, for whatever reason, I feel like Misaki'd pull that off pretty easily.
【Madoka】
Apart from that, I saw some of the others moving in weird ways. You think it's because we're trying something new?
【Masaya】
Huh? What do you mean?
【Madoka】
Mashirocchi was floating around like an astronaut in space.
【Masaya】
...Madoka. That <i>is</i> something normal for her. Not that that makes it any less of a mistake, though.
【Madoka】
Oh, really?
I'm guessing she did the smart thing and changed her Grav Shoes settings from Speeder to Fighter at some point.
But, forgetful as she is, she probably forgot to reset the balancer.
Maybe I need to go over maintenance with her again...
【Masaya】
I'll tell her to be more careful. So, you notice anything else?
【Madoka】
Hm... Not really?
【Madoka】
Oh, except...
【Masaya】
Hm?
Madoka looks both pleased and exasperated. Odd.
【Madoka】
Asuka-chan didn't complain even once.
【Masaya】
I see.
【Madoka】
And she looked so dead by the end that I thought she was going to keel over.
It was the same when she was running basic drills. Asuka's good at taking everything in stride.
Guess that's why she tends to improve faster than anyone else I know. Her ability to devote her entire mind and body to practice is something special.
Maybe she'll actually pull this off...
Yeah, I'm sure--
【Asuka】
Haaah... Phew...
【Masaya】
Huh...? Asuka?!
Asuka walks out of the clubroom, looking almost unrecognizable.
【Misaki】
Come on, clear the way!
【Mashiro】
Asuka-senpaaai, can't you, um... balance yourself better?
Misaki and Mashiro are supporting her as she walks.
【Asuka】
Ugh...
She looks like a criminal who's being taken into custody by two police officers. Man, she must be <i>really</i> out of it.
【Asuka】
Oh, Masaya...shan.
【Masaya】
H-Hey, are you okay, Asuka?
【Misaki】
Hands off. No touching the patient.
【Masaya】
Patient...? I mean, she does look pretty burned out...
【Mashiro】
Yeah, it kind of felt like she was flying through sheer force of will at the end there.
【Masaya】
Next time, stop her before it gets to that point.
【Mashiro】
We <i>did</i> try to stop her...
【Shion】
Yeah. Kurashina insisted we continue.
Prez appears and backs up Mashiro's statement.
【Masaya】
I see...
【Misaki】
You better have a word with her.
【Masaya】
Will do.
Yeah, I need to stop her before this develops into a serious problem. Don't want this becoming a habit.
【Masaya】
Asuka, um, when you're exhausted, you should...
【Asuka】
Masaya...san. Practice today was very... hard, but, er, um...
【Asuka】
It was <i>suuuper</i> fun!
【Masaya】
...I see.
I give her a gentle pat on the shoulder.
【Masaya】
Anyway, we should get you home. Make sure you get a good night's sleep, okay?
【Asuka】
O-Okaaay...
Asuka nods.
I take Asuka's arms from Mashiro and wrap them around my neck.
【Masaya】
I'll make sure she gets home safe.
【Misaki】
You better!
【Mashiro】
Be careful.
【Masaya】
I will. Guess I'll have to carry her all the way home, since she can't walk straight.
【Madoka】
Hinata-kun, Hinata-kun.
Madoka approaches me with a weird grin plastered onto her face.
【Masaya】
I've got a <i>really</i> bad feeling about what you're gonna say, but go ahead.
【Madoka】
Look, I know this is the perfect chance for you to make a move on her and all, but--
【Madoka】
Ugh!
【Masaya】
...Okay, we're leaving.
【Misaki】
Later!
【Mashiro】
Make sure you take her straight home, Senpai. No detours.
【Masaya】
Obviously!
【Masaya】
Haaah... I'm almost there...
I've been flying for about five minutes now. Having Asuka hang off my shoulder is making this a lot harder than usual.
Well, at least we're finally near our neighborhood's terminal.
【Masaya】
Damn that Madoka. I swear, I'm gonna replace her with the teddy bear again.
I know she's just trying to lighten the mood, but it's still <i>really</i> annoying.
【Masaya】
Hey, Asuka...
I look at her as I try to tell her we're almost there.
【Masaya】
Asuka...?
【Asuka】
Zzz... Mhhh...
【Masaya】
...Seriously?
She has been a lot more quiet than I expected. Guess I should've known.
Man, I know I'm here to keep an eye on her, but this is still pretty damn dangerous.
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
...In more ways than one.
Maybe I haven't been thinking about it lately because she hardly ever stops talking.
But I've gotta say, her face looks very well-proportioned from up close. Or, well...
...She's really cute.
【Masaya】
Damn you, Madoka!
Her dumb joke is keeping me from thinking straight!
【Masaya】
Pull yourself together, Masaya! We're flying here! This is no time to get distracted!
I try to focus my eyes on our flight path after saying that.
But...
【Masaya】
Hm...
...Yeah, she's <i>definitely</i> cute.
【Masaya】
Agh, I'm doing it again!
Honestly, I thought she was cute the moment I first met her.
So this isn't really news or anything.
But this feels oddly refreshing after weeks of nothing but practice.
【Aoi】
...Hi. Yeah, it's me. Sorry for the sudden call.
【Aoi】
Can you come check on how they're doing one of these days?
【Aoi】
I know. I realize you have your own position to worry about. Trust me, I'll make sure it doesn't cause any problems.
【Aoi】
Oh, the case we discussed before? Sorry, I don't have an answer for you yet. Tell them to wait until after the fall tournament.
【Aoi】
Okay. See you around.
【Shirase】
Oh!
【Shindou】
Wow...!
【Rika】
Whoa...
【Shirase】
Fancy meeting you here, Shindou-kun.
【Shindou】
Indeed. It's been a while, hasn't it? I'm sorry I didn't come to see you during the summer tournament.
【Shirase】
Nah, it's all good. More importantly...
【Shirase】
Oh, ohhh...!
【Shirase】
Okay, I get the picture.
【Shindou】
Is something wrong?
【Shirase】
Oh, no, don't mind me. Are you guys here to check on Kunahama's players?
【Shindou】
Yeah, we are.
【Shirase】
Cool. Let's get going, then. I need to go say hi to their advisor first, so can you wait here for me?
【Shindou】
Of course. I wouldn't dare refuse your request.
【Shirase】
Cool it, man. That's a bit much. Well, I'll be back in a bit.
【Rika】
Um, President...
【Shindou】
What is it?
【Rika】
That person is the manager of Shirase Sky Sports, isn't he?
【Shindou】
He is. What about it?
【Rika】
Oh, nothing. I'm just surprised that you two are so close.
【Shindou】
Of course we are. As a store manager, he's close with everyone who plays FC in the area.
【Rika】
Oh, good point.
【Shindou】
Though, I also have a more personal relationship with him than most.
【Rika】
Huh?
【Shindou】
In my eyes, he's a god.
【Rika】
Wh-What...?
【Shindou】
Oh, he's back. Let's get moving.
【Rika】
Y-Yeah...
【Rika】
I had to have misheard that, right...?
【Masaya】
Oh!
【Madoka】
Wow!
I notice a number of familiar faces when I turn toward the main school building.
【Shirase】
Yo. Wow, you guys seem to be working real hard.
【Shindou】
Hello.
【Rika】
Here, we brought some drinks.
【Madoka】
Wow, thanks a ton, Ichinose-san!
【Masaya】
Can't say I expected to see you guys together.
【Shirase】
We just ran into each other on the way... Anyway...
Shirase-san shifts his gaze over to what's going on behind me.
【Shirase】
That looks pretty interesting.
【Masaya】
I'd say it's more like a desperate measure than anything.
【Asuka】
Haaah... Haaah... Haaah... Haaah...
Asuka is panting heavily as she faces Misaki.
【Misaki】
Aight, let's wrap this up with one more go!
【Asuka】
Okay! I'm ready!
【Misaki】
Go, Mashiro!
【Mashiro】
Roger, Senpai!
Misaki's body suddenly disappears from Asuka's view right as Mashiro gives that reply.
【Shindou】
...She's fast.
That's putting it lightly, Shindou-san.
【Asuka】
Ugh!
The two of them fly toward Asuka, with Misaki closing in from the left and Mashiro from the right.
【Asuka】
Not yet... I can't move just yet.
Asuka focuses on their movements as she mutters those words.
【Misaki】
I've got this!
When she gets into Asuka's blind spot, Misaki shifts into a rapid climb, then swiftly dives to go for her back.
【Rika】
Such perfect timing...!
Yeah, the way she seamlessly transitioned from one movement to the next is pretty damn impressive.
However...
【Asuka】
Not on my watch!
【Misaki】
Ah...!
Asuka evades Misaki's hand and retreats backward like she's doing a Fosbury Flop.
【Mashiro】
Now's my chance! Take this!
Mashiro tries to take advantage of the tiny window in which Asuka has to try and regain her balance.
【Shirase】
Oof, she's in a tough spot.
Definitely. Most players can't dodge a second attack that's coming in from a different angle right away.
【Asuka】
One more time...!
【Mashiro】
How?!
And yet...
Asuka cancels the loop she's been flying midway, then slips past Mashiro's outstretched hand.
【Rika】
Amazing...!
【Shindou】
They're not done yet.
Ichinose seems amazed by that display, leaving only Shindou-san to notice the last obstacle I've placed in Asuka's way.
【Shion】
Hahaha! You've still got a lot to learn, Kurashina!
Prez shooting down on her from above at a terrifying speed.
【Shirase】
Wow, a third attack!
Asuka's back is wide open now.
And Prez's hand is rushing straight toward it.
【Shirase】
Oh, he must've caught her.
【Shindou】
No. Look closer.
Yep, he's right.
【Asuka】
I-I'm sorry, I just reacted and ended up touching you...
【Shion】
D-Damn it! We're finally at a point where I can't even touch you, huh?
A seemingly frustrated Prez and an oddly apologetic Asuka are floating near the water's surface.
【Rika】
Asuka-san's the one who caught him!
【Shirase】
Whoa...
Now that Asuka's successfully scored a point, this practice has come to an end.
【Rika】
What?! You got to that level in just a week?!
【Asuka】
Y-Yes, that's right.
【Rika】
Amazing... I assumed you started practicing a lot earlier.
Ichinose's really confused by Asuka's rapid improvement. Can't say I blame her, either.
【Misaki】
It's hard enough for me to believe.
【Mashiro】
You can say that again. Asuka-senpai's changing a lot every single day.
【Shion】
My all-in rushes don't even work on her anymore.
【Asuka】
I-Is that so...?
【Madoka】
Yeah, he's got no chance against you. It's safe to say you've easily surpassed Shion.
【Shion】
That hurts, Madoka...
【Rika】
You really are amazing...
Ichinose keeps up the mountain of compliments.
【Rika】
If you keep this up, finishing in the top four of the fall tournament won't be a challenge!
【Masaya】
Uh... That's good to hear?
I turn toward Shindou-san and Shirase-san, who seem to be lost in thought, after acknowledging Ichinose's praise.
They look pretty damn serious right now.
【Masaya】
...Shirase-san.
【Shirase】
What's up, Masaya?
I close my eyes for a moment to gather my thoughts.
【Masaya】
You don't think this is enough, do you?
Our jolly mood suddenly turns tense.
Shirase-san smiles faintly as everyone turns their eyes toward him.
【Shirase】
Well, what's your opinion?
【Masaya】
I...
Asuka's <i>definitely</i> improved a lot this past week.
And I'm sure she'd put up a much better fight if she got another practice match.
But...
【Masaya】
I don't think this enough to help her beat Saki Inui.
【Asuka】
Urk...
I hear Asuka's breath catch in her throat.
She deserves a ton of praise, but now's not the time to sugarcoat things.
Shirase-san nods upon hearing my words.
【Shirase】
I agree. At this rate, she won't even scratch her.
...Damn, so Shirase-san thinks there's still a huge gap between them?
I mean, I think Asuka's chances are pretty slim right now, but his assessment seems much harsher.
【Shirase】
What do you say, Shindou-kun?
Shirase-san turns to Shindou-san, who's standing next to him, as he says that.
【Shirase】
Why don't you face Asuka-chan?
【Masaya】
What?!
【Asuka】
I get to fight Shindou-san again...!
Asuka versus Shindou-san?
That'd be a godsend, but is that really okay?
Sure, he retired from competition after the summer tournament, but he's still Takafuji's president.
He's supposed to be coaching his own players, like Ichinose and Satouin-san, so helping another school seems kinda unethical.
【Shindou】
Shirase-san...
【Shirase】
Yeah?
【Shindou】
Great minds think alike. I was just about to suggest the exact same thing.
【Masaya】
...Seriously?
【Shindou】
I'm glad I brought my equipment just in case.
【Shirase】
Nice. I like the way you do things.
...They look pretty happy.
【Masaya】
Asuka, are you--
I'm worried that she may be too exhausted to do this, but I keep myself from voicing my doubt.
【Asuka】
I get to... face Shindou-san again!
Her motivation is palpable, so I've probably got nothing to worry about.
【Masaya】
...Okay, we'll take you up on that offer, Shindou-san.
【Shindou】
I'm very glad to hear that, Hinata-kun.
【Shion】
Okay, this practice match between Takafuji Academy and Kunahama Academy will now begin.
【Shion】
Both players are to move to first.
Asuka and Shindou-san, who had been waiting a little further away, move toward the buoy after hearing that.
【Asuka】
Th-Thank you for giving me this opportunity!
【Shindou】
You're more than welcome.
【Shindou】
The last time we played against each other was in the tournament.
【Asuka】
Y-Yes!
【Shindou】
Let's make it a good match.
Shindou-san is his usual calm, collected self.
...Though, I already know that everything will change once the match begins.
【Rika】
Do you remember what Shindou-senpai said?
Ichinose addresses me, seemingly confused.
【Masaya】
What do you mean?
【Rika】
Um, when Shirase-san suggested the match, he replied, "Great minds think alike."
【Rika】
I wonder why... He has to have a reason for wanting to face her, right?
【Masaya】
Now that you mention it... Yeah, you're right.
There's no way he wants to play her for fun. He's not that kind of person. If anything, he's more the cold, calculated type who's generally unwilling to show his hand.
But despite that, he suggested this practice match.
【Masaya】
He probably has something he wants to share. Something that'll help Asuka when the time comes for her to face Inui...
【Rika】
Maybe he noticed something specific when he fought Inui-san.
【Masaya】
Yeah... Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
【Rika】
...That's true.
Ichinose's watching the match with bated breath.
Both of us know this isn't a simple practice match.
However, only Shindou-san knows the true purpose of it at the moment.
【Shion】
Ready, set...!
【Masaya】
(Show us what you've got, Shindou-san.)
It seems Shindou-san arrived at the exact same conclusion as Shirase-san. He doesn't think Asuka stands a chance against Inui right now.
So, I'm sure there's some lesson to be learned from this match. That has to be why he suggested it.
The match has begun.
Both players charge straight toward second.
【Masaya】
Huh?
...No, that's not true. What the hell?
【Asuka】
What?
Asuka's just as surprised as me.
Shindou-san should have been rushing down toward second.
【Shindou】
Hm...
However, he's given up and jumped to the second line.
【Rika】
That's odd...
I mean, yeah.
He's a Speeder leaning All-Rounder.
Why would he give up on second against a non-Speeder?
He's clearly up to something.
【Masaya】
Asuka, be careful.
【Asuka】
Shindou-san's probably going to try to surprise me, right?
【Masaya】
Yep. After you touch second, check your surroundings and pay attention to what he's doing.
【Asuka】
Understood!
Asuka keeps moving toward second.
And it doesn't take long for her to reach it.
That's 1:0 for her.
However, a single point lead against Shindou-san is effectively nothing.
【Masaya】
Okay, Asuka, next...
Should I have her rush toward third...? No, Shindou-san'll <i>definitely</i> get in her way.
Hm, maybe a dogfight would work better, since that's what she's been training lately?
This is tough...
【Masaya】
Wait, what?!
No way...
【Asuka】
Masaya-san, that's...!
Asuka stops in her tracks. She's clearly surprised.
【Shindou】
Heh...
Shindou-san spreads out his arms with a faint smile on his face.
He's floating at the center of the second line.
Right above it, in fact.
【Asuka】
Ah...!
【Shindou】
What's wrong? Come at me, Kurashina-kun.
He's become a wall.
【Masaya】
Ah...!
I see. Now I get it.
【Misaki】
What's happening? I don't get it.
【Masaya】
Shindou-san isn't going with his usual playstyle.
【Misaki】
Huh?
【Rika】
Hm, his movements <i>do</i> seem different... But then, what is he trying to do?
【Masaya】
Well...
Strong Skywalkers can freely switch between playing as a Speeder, Fighter, or All-Rounder.
And the best among them can even imitate someone else's playstyle to a certain extent, effectively becoming that player.
【Masaya】
He's acting like Saki Inui.
【Misaki】
No way!
【Rika】
Really?!
【Masaya】
Yeah, I'm sure.
Shindou-san obviously didn't witness the match that took place last week.
So, this must be based on his analysis of when he fought her.
It's just like in soccer, where you can guess a team's plan by the way their players are positioned. Or in boxing, where you can read things based on an opponent's stance.
By looking at his positioning and form, I can accurately surmise his current playstyle.
【Masaya】
I know I shouldn't be surprised, but damn...
He's masterfully replicating Inui's Bird Cage after only experiencing it once.
I can clearly envision it now.
【Asuka】
...Ugh!
Asuka lets out a frustrated groan. Guess Shindou-san's bringing up bad memories of that practice match from last week...
I know she's not traumatized or anything, but his accurate recreation of Inui's style seems to have dampened Asuka's spirits.
【Masaya】
Huh?
Wait, what?
【Masaya】
He's getting closer?
I thought he was just recreating Inui's playstyle.
But it seems to be a little different somehow.
【Shindou】
Hehe...
Slowly but surely, Shindou-san is closing in on Asuka as if to pressure her.
And the faint smile on his face is just making it worse.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san, he's...
【Masaya】
You noticed?
【Asuka】
Yes, Shindou-san is coming closer.
Glad I'm not the only one who caught that.
【Masaya】
I see. I was wrong.
【Misaki】
Wrong about what?
【Masaya】
I thought Shindou-san was imitating Inui.
【Misaki】
Huh? Wait, he isn't?
【Rika】
But you seemed so sure...
【Masaya】
Yeah, but now I know that's not the case.
Shindou-san gave up on second right after the match began.
And that means, unlike Inui, he's starting at a disadvantage.
【Masaya】
This isn't the Bird Cage. It's more like a shark approaching its prey with its jaws wide open.
Or one of those moments in games where a wall's closing in on you from behind.
That's all his movements make me think of.
【Masaya】
Asuka, go up.
【Asuka】
Up?
【Masaya】
He'll smush you if you keep waiting. Climb diagonally upward to match his altitude, then engage him in a dogfight.
【Asuka】
Got it!
Asuka builds up momentum and rushes at Shindou-san.
She's gotta get to the same altitude as him to kill any advantage he has.
However...
【Shindou】
Try again.
【Asuka】
Eeek!
Shindou-san blocks her path with pitch perfect timing. Guess he read her movements.
He maintains his higher elevation, never letting his relative position go.
【Masaya】
Of course it isn't gonna be easy...
Well, at least now it's clear what he's trying to do.
He's making sure to never yield the high ground.
It's the exact same type of FC that Inui's playing. The "true FC" that focuses on controlling your opponent that Irina-san went on about.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san, what should I do?
Asuka sounds pretty nervous.
Hm, she's been training to counter this for a week now, so this is a good opportunity.
Sure, he can't reproduce Inui's exact style, but it's definitely better than nothing.
【Masaya】
Asuka.
【Asuka】
Yes!
【Masaya】
Put some distance between you two. Make sure to stay out of his reach!
【Asuka】
U-Understood!
Asuka follows my instructions and tries to escape Shindou-san by moving slightly downward.
【Masaya】
No! Don't do that!
【Asuka】
Huh?
I've got a bad feeling here.
I'm sure that was the best way to escape from her perspective.
However, there's no way Shindou-san won't react to that when he's been obsessed with maintaining the high ground this whole time.
【Shindou】
Haha! Thanks for playing right into my hand!
Shit!
【Asuka】
Eeek!
It only took an instant.
He swooped down from his high position and scored.
【Shion】
That's one point for Kazunari Shindou!
Prez's voice resounds through the area. Shindou-san has evened things up now.
【Masaya】
Stay focused, Asuka!
【Asuka】
Huh?!
【Masaya】
He's <i>definitely</i> gonna go for another point! Watch out!
I feel it in my bones.
There's no doubt in my mind that Shindou-san won't stop at just one.
And...
【Shindou】
I'm not done yet, Kurashina-kun!
【Asuka】
Haaah...!
【Shion】
Th-That's two points for Kazunari Shindou!
Man, why do my premonitions always come true?
Great. Shindou-san's playing with the lead now.
【Masaya】
Ugh...!
Since he repelled her downward, Asuka is near the water surface.
【Masaya】
Do an Airkick Turn! Recover your balance and fly straight up!
【Asuka】
U-Understood...!
I frantically bark out orders, which Asuka obeys.
【Shindou】
Heh... I won't let you escape.
Unfortunately, Shindou-san never lets up.
He simply pursues her like a wild beast that's unwilling to let go of his prey.
【Masaya】
He's incredible.
Asuka manages to somehow retreat toward second.
And when she turns around...
【Asuka】
No... Not again...
We're stuck in the same situation as before.
【Shindou】
What's the matter, Kurashina-kun?
Shindou-san spreads his arms in an almost elegant fashion, effectively cutting off Asuka's path once again.
【Masaya】
Asuka, fly a zigzag and close in on him from the side!
【Asuka】
U-Understood!
No point going for vertical movement again. It'd be the same as bashing her head into a wall. Catching him off guard with a zigzag seems like the best bet, but...
【Shindou】
You think throwing in some horizontal movement will do the trick?
He sees right through our plan.
【Masaya】
Ugh!
【Shindou】
Try again!
He's like an eagle targeting a fish in the water...
【Asuka】
No...!
【Shion】
That's three points for Kazunari Shindou!
He won't let the fish escape his clutches.
【Masaya】
I see... This is it.
I gaze at that eagle as it spreads its wings in a menacing manner.
【Masaya】
This is Shindou-san's answer!
"This is about what you should expect from Saki Inui. How can you defeat her with only that type of practice?"
Shindou-san is confronting us with the cold, hard truth.
There's no way Asuka'll win at this rate.
He's showing us the bad ending we would've reached in two months.
【Misaki】
Haha! Man, he's amazing.
Misaki's voice is full of admiration.
【Mashiro】
Asuka-senpai's improved so much, but she still doesn't stand a chance.
Mashiro seemingly falls into despair.
【Rika】
Shindou-senpai...
Ichinose looks to be conflicted.
And I'm not surprised. I mean, I'm sure she's never seen Shindou-san play like this.
And this playstyle is the very same one that made him suffer that humiliating defeat.
He's essentially admitting that his old playstyle wasn't anywhere near good enough.
【Masaya】
Still, that's honestly a good thing.
The whole reason Shindou-san's so good is that he adapts to every situation. He's strong because he continually evolves his game.
The best players don't obsess over playstyle.
Instead, they're willing to do whatever it takes to pull out a win.
That's how Aoi-san used to play when she was a pro, anyway.
【Masaya】
We'll just have to work harder.
After that, we keep throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks, but Asuka's repelled every single time, which lets Shindou-san rack up more and more points.
Shortly before the end of the match, Shindou-san leisurely moves to third and touches it, which brings his imposing display to a clear end.
He controlled every aspect of this match from start to finish.
【Asuka】
Phew... I'm back.
【Shindou】
Thanks for the match.
【Madoka】
Great match, guys! Oh, uh, hold on, I'll bring some drinks.
【Rika】
Here's a towel, Shindou-senpai!
【Shindou】
Thank you.
The atmosphere finally relaxes once they land.
However, all my thoughts and feelings about that match are still bubbling up inside.
【Shirase】
That was real interesting.
Shirase-san welcomes Asuka and Shindou-san back with a smile, then turns to me.
【Shirase】
...Do you get it now, Masaya?
I give him a silent nod.
【Masaya】
Our practice has trained her moment-to-moment decision making skill, so she's now good at dealing with situations where she doesn't know what's coming at her, or from where.
【Shirase】
But that's not enough when you're facing someone who controls the pace of play like Saki Inui.
【Masaya】
...Right.
【Shirase】
I'm sure what we just saw made you realize that her playstyle is like hard, thick armor.
That's a good way to put it.
After all, knowing how to deal with multiple spear thrusts in quick succession doesn't actually help you pierce an opponent's defenses.
That's why both Shindou-san and Shirase-san were so down on our practice.
【Shirase】
As for what you should do... Well, I'm sure Shindou-kun can provide some answers.
Shindou-san returns after wiping his face down with a towel.
【Shindou】
I worked up a sweat there. That was some good exercise.
His voice sounds as carefree as ever despite the grave expression on his face.
【Shindou】
Hinata-kun, may I ask you a question?
【Masaya】
Shoot.
【Shindou】
What kind of attack do you think would be most effective against Saki Inui?
Hm...
Well, Shirase-san <i>did</i> just say that Inui's playstyle makes her like thick armor.
And that means no normal attacks will ever be enough.
【Masaya】
A sharp, unstoppable thrust.
I originally started up this three versus one practice to help develop a unique weapon for Asuka.
And today's match has basically solidified that goal in my mind.
【Shindou】
You want a weapon that will let you power through her and shatter her armor?
I shake my head in response.
【Masaya】
No, that's not what I mean. All we need to do is pierce the small gaps between the plates of her armor.
Since there's no chance of winning a straight up fight, it's best to watch for an opening before targeting it.
That's the only way Asuka, who's severely lacking in the experience department, can possibly win.
【Shindou】
...I see.
Shindou-san nods.
【Shindou】
I agree. It would be foolish to rely on brute force.
【Shindou】
However, Inui's armor is quite thick. I'm not sure you'll be able to find a gap, let alone exploit it.
【Masaya】
...But I am. I know Asuka can do it.
【Shindou】
I see.
【Shindou】
Her playstyle is rather interesting, so that seems promising.
Guess he's satisfied with my idea.
Though, with that said, I don't have a concrete plan in my mind at all.
I mean, that whole idea is based on actually finding a weakness, which is going to be <i>really</i> difficult.
We need something unique, but it also has to be well thought out, or Asuka'll become even easier prey.
【Masaya】
(...Guess I should give this more thought.)
Shindou-san and Shirase-san have helped me solidify a course of action.
However, in a way, we're now back to square one.
【Shirase】
...Oh, someone's texting me. Hold on.
【Shirase】
I'm going to drop by the faculty room on my own, Shindou-kun. Leave on your own once you're done here.
【Shindou】
Understood.
【Shirase】
Well, keep up the good work, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Thanks.
Is Shirase-san busy? No, wait, he's heading to the faculty room, so he must have business with Aoi-san.
【Shindou】
Hinata-kun.
【Masaya】
Uh, what's up?
Shindou-san's back to his usual, relaxed self.
There's even a cheerful smile on his face.
【Shindou】
Answer a question for me, Hinata-kun.
【Shindou】
Imagine you have a player who doesn't have any FC matches coming up. Someone who has essentially nothing to do in his free time.
【Shindou】
Would you let that person be Kurashina-kun's training partner?
【Masaya】
Someone who has nothing to do in his free time? Wait, you don't mean...
I look up at Shindou-san's smiling face and--
【Masaya】
H-Huuuh?!
No way...
【Shindou】
What do you say? Am I not good enough for the job?
【Masaya】
D-Don't be silly. If you aren't, then literally no one is.
...If anything, I feel like he's wasted on us.
If a player as good as Shindou-san practices with Asuka, she'll improve in no time.
It's a dream come true, but...
【Masaya】
Um...
I throw a sidelong glance at Ichinose.
I doubt people from Takafuji would be very happy to hear that. I mean, who would be when their best player is offering to train one of their rivals.
However...
【Rika】
...Don't worry. He informed me in advance.
Ichinose forms a light smile as she says that.
【Masaya】
I-I see.
I didn't believe this was some spur of the moment decision, but I also didn't think he'd already told his club about it... Guess I've got no reason to turn him down now.
【Masaya】
W-Well, okay then... Heeey, Asukaaa!
I call Asuka over.
【Asuka】
Y-Yes, what is it?
【Masaya】
You're getting an extra coach starting tomorrow.
【Asuka】
Huh? Um, who?
I point at Shindou-san.
【Asuka】
Wh-Whaaat?!
【Shindou】
That's the story, Kurashina-kun.
【Asuka】
U-Um, uh, you've still got practice at Takafuji, so, um, are you <i>really</i> sure this is fine?!
【Shindou】
Of course I am. I'm looking forward to it.
Asuka's all flustered, while Shindou-san, in sharp contrast, just smiles and shakes hands with her.
【Shindou】
Now, with that out of the way, let's get right down to finding a gap in Saki Inui's armor.
【Masaya】
Um, Shindou-san.
【Shindou】
What is it?
【Masaya】
Thank you.
【Shindou】
Haha. You don't need to thank me.
【Shindou】
This may be your fight, but at the same time, it's a way for me to get my revenge...
【Masaya】
Right...
Should've known. There's no way Shindou-san's over the defeat he suffered.
And that's part of the reason why he wants to help us.
Honestly, I'm grateful for his help, but this is putting a lot more pressure on me...
【Shindou】
Also...
【Masaya】
Hm?
【Shindou】
I simply can't refuse a request from one of my gods.
【Masaya】
...What?
【Shirase】
That's a pretty bold move.
【Aoi】
What do you mean?
【Shirase】
Getting Shindou-kun to coach her. I can't believe you just went there and made it happen when he's from a different school.
【Aoi】
Well, it's not like he's getting nothing in return.
【Shirase】
Huh?! Don't tell me... you're talking about that Northern Europe League stuff from the other day?
【Aoi】
Don't you think putting someone who has as much fun playing FC as Shindou overseas could lead to interesting developments?
【Shirase】
...I see. You've already sealed the deal with the folks over there and found a school for him, huh?
【Aoi】
It must get pretty cold in Finland. Guess I'll have to mail him some warm blankets when winter rolls around.
【Shirase】
I don't even know how to respond...
【Shirase】
So, what are their chances?
【Aoi】
What do you mean?
【Shirase】
I'm asking if you think Asuka-chan can win.
【Aoi】
To be honest, I don't know.
【Shirase】
...I see.
【Aoi】
She's a real quick study, which is good. Plus, she's got a strong desire to win and enough tenacity to spare.
【Aoi】
But the issue is, she'll hit a ceiling eventually. And when that happens, he's the only one who can help her bust right through it.
【Shirase】
You mean Masaya?
【Aoi】
Right now, he isn't paying attention to the people around him, so it'll all depend on how he recovers after he realizes his mistake.
【Shirase】
...You're not going to warn him?
【Aoi】
He needs to experience it himself in order to understand. Failing alongside Kurashina will help him grow.
【Aoi】
Then again, it won't be easy. I mean, he's already experienced the effects of a bad coach first-hand.
【Shirase】
Aoi, you...
【Aoi】
...It's pretty cloudy out there. We might get some rain today.
【Shindou】
Okay, come at me, Kurashina-kun!
【Asuka】
Gladly!
Asuka starts to slowly fly a Scissors as though to get a feel for it.
It's a maneuver that's typically used to switch positions with your opponent when they're behind you in a dogfight.
It's weird to use it as an approach, but that's exactly what Asuka is doing.
【Asuka】
Uh...!
The angles of her turns quickly become unnaturally sharp. Right now, her trajectory's more like a zigzag than a wavy line.
Shindou-san is calmly observing everything.
Asuka then starts to fly around in an attempt to draw a pentagram.
It's a sequence of multiple Scissors with acute angle turns.
【Asuka】
Ugh...!
After several turns, Asuka suddenly rushes at Shindou-san.
She's shooting straight at Shindou-san's blind spot at a high speed.
【Shindou】
Alright, that's a good feint, but...
【Asuka】
Eek!
Shindou-san twists and nimbly climbs up, seemingly having predicted Asuka's position.
【Shindou】
You looked at me right before you launched your attack.
【Asuka】
O-Oh, did I...?
【Shindou】
If I managed to catch that, then so will Inui-kun. Ichinose-kun, what did you see?
【Rika】
When she made her last turn, she changed the way her body was positioned.
【Shindou】
...You heard it.
【Asuka】
O-Oh... It was no good, huh?
【Shindou】
It would be strange if you managed to pull it off right away. You are attempting a rather high-level technique, after all.
【Shindou】
Alright, let's take it from the top. This time, try to not give yourself away by focusing your gaze.
【Asuka】
U-Understood!
【Madoka】
Wow, Shindou-san sure is fired up.
【Masaya】
Yeah. He's doing great out there. Every problem is getting stamped out one after another.
It's been a week since Shindou-san joined us.
And I've gotta say, he's a lot more passionate and engaged than I imagined.
【Madoka】
I hope this zigzag attack you came up with will work...
【Masaya】
Luckily, we have Shindou-san here, so she can practice it. If she can get to the point where she can land it on him, she can land it on just about anyone.
The idea is that Asuka will first use herself as a decoy to throw Inui off and break her defense.
It's an advanced feint, basically. The lightning-fast speed combined with the swift and rapid directional changes make it almost impossible for your opponent to predict where you're going to attack from.
The idea is simple on paper, but the effectiveness of it scales with the skill of the player, meaning it can become an incredibly deadly move with the right amount of intuition and technical ability.
【Masaya】
Inui is definitely improving as we speak.
【Madoka】
Huh?
【Masaya】
They must've shown us the Bird Cage because us knowing couldn't hurt them, right?
【Madoka】
Ohhh, I see. Good point.
【Masaya】
In other words, Inui will have reached new heights by the time we face her.
And I've got no way to predict what that'll look like.
【Madoka】
You're saying she stands no chance if she can't deal with the Bird Cage right off the bat, huh?
【Masaya】
Exactly.
Filled with expectation, I look up at Asuka as she's flying about.
【Masaya】
If she manages to master this technique, she can put up a good fight.
Of course, she's still struggling to even learn it, which isn't a good sign.
Still, based on how she's improved so far, I'm excited to see how this looks in a couple days.
【Asuka】
I'm so exhausted...
【Masaya】
I can imagine. You did great out there, Asuka.
Asuka walks over to me with unsteady steps.
【Asuka】
You have to hear this, Masaya-san!
【Asuka】
I finally managed to score on Shindou-san today!
【Masaya】
Yeah, I saw everything. You managed to pull off an attack that was practically impossible to read.
【Asuka】
I did! And I'll work hard to score even more points next time!
【Misaki】
A-su-ka!
【Asuka】
Oh...! M-Misaki-chan...
Misaki grabs Asuka's arm with a mischievous look on her face.
【Misaki】
Now that your break's over, it's our turn!
【Shion】
I'll use my speed to defeat you!
【Mashiro】
And I'll aim for your back the whole time!
【Asuka】
U-Uhhh... Saveee meee...
Asuka gets dragged away.
【Masaya】
Make sure you don't go easy on her!
Shindou-san approaches me now. What, was he waiting to take Asuka's place or something?
【Masaya】
Thanks for the help.
【Shindou】
It's no problem, really... I see Tobisawa-kun and the others are also quite fired up.
【Masaya】
Yeah. Thanks to the advice you gave, their practice has gotten a lot more effective.
The "weapon" Shindou-san came up with requires immense agility and moment-to-moment decision making skill.
That's why we're splitting up practice into two halves.
【Shindou】
I haven't really done much. Adjusting their positioning and making their individual roles clearer was no big deal.
【Masaya】
Uh, I think you're underselling yourself there...
I mean, everyone's been a lot more lively since we clearly defined their roles.
Sure, the main focus of this exercise is Asuka, but it's also supposed to help all of them develop their technical skills.
【Shindou】
I think the bigger factor here is that all your players know <i>exactly</i> what they're doing. That's what allows you to--
【Mashiro】
Heeeeeelp!
I hear a scream come from up in the sky.
【Asuka】
M-Mashiro-chan, are you okay?!
【Shion】
She's spinning around in the air. Is that some new technique?
【Misaki】
You forgot to reset the balancer again, didn't you?
【Mashiro】
I'm sorryyy! It's <i>really</i> hard to remember!
【Shindou】
......
【Masaya】
......
Guess he spoke too soon.
I'm beginning to think I should make Mashiro take a maintenance course...
【Shindou】
I have to say, today was extremely productive.
【Masaya】
Oh?
【Shindou】
Kurashina-kun is very talented. This practice is driving that fact home.
【Shindou】
She never repeats the same mistake, which is remarkable. I've never come across anyone else like her.
【Masaya】
Glad I'm not the only one who thinks that.
【Shindou】
I understand why you're so obsessed with her.
He has a strange grin on his face as he says that.
【Masaya】
Uh, we're talking about her as a player, right?
【Shindou】
Hm? What else could I mean? Explain.
...Damn it! He pulled a fast one on me!
【Shindou】
Well, we can chat about that some other time. I need to head out.
【Masaya】
G-Got it. See you...
Can't believe I let him get to me...
I mean, Asuka <i>is</i> very captivating as a player, which makes me happy to coach her, but...
【Rika】
Um, Hinata-san.
【Masaya】
Y-Yeah...! Oh, it's you, Ichinose.
【Rika】
I'm going to head home now.
【Masaya】
Oh, okay, understood.
【Rika】
......
【Masaya】
...What?
【Rika】
Are you sure you think of her as just a player to coach?
【Masaya】
Wow, I didn't expect you to dig into that!
【Madoka】
Hehe... Boss, I got what ya want riiight here!
Madoka pulls a USB out of her bag with a creepy smile on her face.
【Masaya】
I see. Well done, Madoka.
【Madoka】
Hehe... It was no sweat.
Madoka holds out her palms after handing me the USB.
【Masaya】
I'll reward you if Asuka wins the tournament.
【Madoka】
Huh?! Don't you think that's a pretty steep requirement?
【Masaya】
Enough. Let's just watch it.
【Madoka】
Fiiine! Look, there are a lot on your side.
There's a laptop in front of us.
And Madoka spots a couple of open USB slots on the left.
【Masaya】
Okay, here we go.
I insert the USB, which makes a folder with a date as its name pop up on the screen... Inside, there's one video file.
【Masaya】
Is this it?
【Madoka】
Yep. You'll see a real dirty video of me once you open it...
【Madoka】
Oh, <i>come on!</i> You could at least pretend to hesitate!
【Masaya】
Shut up already! Oh, there we go.
It's a video of Saki Inui.
【Masaya】
When was this filmed?
【Madoka】
About a year ago. It's from a summer tournament last year.
That said, it's a tournament that took place in a different country, so it's not the same as the one we just finished.
I wanted to learn more about Saki Inui, so I used Madoka's information network to find this.
【Madoka】
Why not compliment my <i>amazing</i> information gathering skills?
...Honestly, I am pretty grateful, but there's no way I'm gonna reward that annoying behavior.
【Masaya】
Oh, this is...
The video only had Inui until now, but another player has suddenly appeared.
【Madoka】
It's a dogfight.
They're keeping each other in check while they search for an opportunity to strike.
Neither of them are really making a move.
【Madoka】
Oh, the English player's a guy.
【Masaya】
Mhm...
【Madoka】
He's tall, but still pretty fast. Seems like a tough opponent.
【Masaya】
His name is Anthony Flockhart. He placed third in the Europe Junior Championship.
【Madoka】
Oh, I see... You sure know a lot about this stuff, huh?
【Masaya】
I guess... Oh, look, he's made his move.
Unable to stand waiting around, he took advantage of Inui moving slightly to the left and shot toward the next buoy.
【Madoka】
He's done for at this rate.
Madoka says that on reflex.
But she's right. His timing was bad, so I'm sure Inui'll just stop him in his tracks.
【Masaya】
She'll either fly up, then go for his back with a quick dive or--
Amidst that situation, which was a perfect chance to score multiple points...
【Madoka】
Huuuh?!
【Masaya】
What?!
...Inui did something completely unexpected.
【Madoka】
She jumped to the third line...!
That's right. Instead of going to score on his back, she simply flew over to the third line as if she had no interest in him.
And Flockhart looked over to her with a baffled expression on his face after scoring.
【Masaya】
...I see. Her playstyle has been like this for a while.
【Madoka】
Huh? What do you mean?
【Masaya】
She's ignoring the usual conventions of FC. See, look there.
I point to a part of the video.
Inui is floating above the third line, looking down on her opponent in an intimidating manner.
【Masaya】
This is just a guess, but it feels like Inui wasn't even trying to win.
【Madoka】
Huh? But why...?
【Masaya】
She probably wanted to confirm something in a real tournament setting.
Flockhart is relatively famous in the junior scene in Europe.
However, that doesn't mean much. I'm not trying to badmouth him or anything, but I doubt he was a serious hurdle in Inui's mind.
【Madoka】
...I doubt her opponent was happy about her doing that, though.
【Masaya】
Right. In fact, you can see that on his face.
After the match ended, the camera zoomed in on Flockhart's face.
And he didn't have the smiling face of a winner. Instead, he looked like an animal that feared an incoming predator.
【Masaya】
She's been developing this style for far more than a year...
【Madoka】
Beating her won't come easy, but it's worth the challenge.
There's no way we'll come out on top without working even harder.
It's gonna get harder from here on out.
【Masaya】
Alright, Madoka.
【Madoka】
What?
【Masaya】
I hope you'll have the next video for me soon.
【Madoka】
Hm, well, about that...
Madoka sounds oddly hesitant.
【Madoka】
It'll be hard to get much more. There's barely anything out there.
【Masaya】
Ugh, you serious?
【Madoka】
Yeah. There was some info on her from tournaments in Europe, but even then, this was the only video I managed to find.
【Madoka】
It's like someone's deleting everything about her.
...I can't believe it.
I mean, her playstyle's real special, so videos that show how she developed it must be in demand.
Having nothing out there despite that probably means we have no chance of winning a war of information.
【Madoka】
Our only hope is to sneak into Kairyou.
【Masaya】
Which isn't really a good idea...
【Madoka】
I'm back! Oh, are you done with practice already?
【Misaki】
Yep. Asuka's exhausted, so we called it a day.
【Madoka】
I see. Make sure to get some rest, Asuka-chan.
【Asuka】
......
【Asuka】
...H-Huh? Oh, y-yeah, thanks!
【Madoka】
She seems pretty drained...
【Mashiro】
That's because Asuka-senpai was in peak condition today.
【Shion】
Yeah, she was training even harder than usual.
【Misaki】
Huh? Where's Masaya?
【Madoka】
He went to go talk to Shirase-san. Just told me to say practice will start at the same time tomorrow.
【Misaki】
Hrm... Gotcha.
【Mashiro】
See you tomorrow!
【Shion】
See you!
【Asuka】
B-Bye...
【Madoka】
......
【Masaya】
We could jump to the third line early at the cost of a point. That would get us far ahead of her.
【Masaya】
If we do that, Inui would most likely make her move around here, which we could counter by...
I'm drawing projected trajectories on the whiteboard to try and outsmart Inui and Irina-san.
【Masaya】
...It's no use. This is way too hard without more information.
I put down my pen and cross my arms.
It's easy enough to think up Inui countermeasures in my mind, which is why we incorporate the results of my simulations in our daily practice.
However, I don't have enough tape to figure out what she'd <i>actually</i> do, so it's all based on my assumptions.
【Masaya】
Phew...
I sink into the chair and gaze up at the ceiling.
I can't forget the video I saw yesterday...
【Masaya】
Nothing I can do if even Shirase-san is drawing a blank...
Shirase-san's connected to the FC world on a global scale, but even he can't find anything on her.
【Masaya】
All we can do now is focus on practice.
I can't keep worrying about things we'll never get.
Not when we have last year's fall tournament champion and a former international pro on our side.
Yeah. I just have to focus on practice. There's nothing wrong at all with our practice.
【Misaki】
Heya, Coach.
Misaki suddenly pops into the clubroom.
【Masaya】
Hi. Is everyone ready?
【Misaki】
Yep. We're all warmed up.
【Masaya】
I see. I'll be there in a minute.
【Misaki】
'Kay.
Instead of turning to leave, Misaki remains rooted to the spot.
【Masaya】
Something wrong?
【Misaki】
Maybe I'm worrying over nothing, but...
Misaki looks at me with a concerned expression on her face.
【Misaki】
You sure you're watching Asuka?
【Masaya】
Huh?
...Where'd that come from?
【Masaya】
What do you mean? I see her practice every single day.
【Misaki】
Hm... Well, yeah, but...
【Misaki】
...I guess you're right. Forget I ever said anything.
【Masaya】
Uh, okay...?
What was that all about?
There's no way she said that for no reason.
【Misaki】
'Kay, let's head on out.
【Masaya】
Sure.
In the end, Misaki doesn't elaborate, so the conversation ends.
【Misaki】
Aight, let's pick up where we left off yesterday and kick things up a notch!
【Mashiro】
Roger!
【Shion】
Let's do this!
【Asuka】
...I can't wait!
Now that her practice with Shindou-san is complete, Asuka's moved to her three versus one practice with the rest of our club.
Man, her reaction time has improved a lot.
【Shindou】
Hinata-kun.
【Masaya】
Hey there. How much progress have you--?
I get interrupted before I can finish my sentence.
【Shindou】
You might want to check up on Kurashina-kun.
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Shindou】
Her movements and everything were the same as usual, but she was slow to react when I talked to her, and she seemed out of breath.
【Masaya】
What?
Sure, she's been looking more tired lately, but I didn't know it was that bad.
【Masaya】
Heeey, Misa--
I look up to tell them to stop practice.
And that's when...
【Misaki】
Huh?! Hey, Asuka?!
...Misaki's terrified voice reaches my ears.
【Masaya】
What happened...? Asuka?!
I shift my gaze and notice Asuka floating through the air, her head hanging limply.
【Misaki】
Masayaaa! Asuka just...!
【Masaya】
I'm coming!
Without missing a beat, I open the box that contains the maintenance equipment, pick up a remote that has "emergency" written on it, and take off.
After positioning myself under Asuka, I address the others.
【Masaya】
I'm gonna shutdown Asuka's Grav Shoes, so I need all of you to serve as backup.
【Misaki】
B-Backup?
【Masaya】
Head down, then grab a net and spread it over the water.
【Misaki】
G-Got it...! Prez, Mashiro!
【Shion】
On it!
【Mashiro】
Roger...!
The three of them rush down to the beach.
I wait for them to fetch the net and get in position. Then...
【Masaya】
Are you alright, Asuka?!
【Asuka】
Huh...? I remember I was... in the middle of practice... so why are you...?
What a relief. She's conscious.
That makes the tension in my body loosen up for a moment.
【Masaya】
You got dizzy and passed out.
【Asuka】
O-Oh... I see... I'm sorry...
【Masaya】
Don't worry about that. Just keep quiet and relax.
I use the emergency remote to slowly lower the output of Asuka's Grav Shoes.
Reducing the anti-graviton output should make her sink due to the pull of gravity.
And that's exactly what happens.
【Masaya】
Okay, slow and steady...
Lower anti-gravitons also mean lower repellent force.
In other words, she won't get flung away by my touch.
Instead, she'll only feel a light vibration.
【Masaya】
Phew...
I catch Asuka's body in my arms.
Then, I slowly lower myself down toward the beach.
【Asuka】
Um... What happened to me?
【Masaya】
Don't talk, Asuka. Just stay still.
【Asuka】
O-Okay... I... will...
She mutters that in a tired voice, then closes her eyes again.
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
...I'm sorry.
The immense sense of guilt makes it hard for me to look Asuka straight in the face.
【Madoka】
Yeah, it's pure exhaustion. She isn't sick or anything.
【Masaya】
...I see. Thanks for going with her.
【Madoka】
It's no big deal. I'm the club manager, remember?
We immediately canceled practice and took Asuka to the hospital.
After delivering her safely, I left and returned to our clubroom.
And that's why I only now know about Asuka's condition.
【Masaya】
Misaki tried to warn me...
【Madoka】
Did she say something?
【Masaya】
She was worried about Asuka before practice, but was being kind of vague. I should've actually tried to talk to her...
It's clear now that she was wondering if I was paying attention to Asuka's physical condition, not her progress.
I bet Misaki picked up on the little signs of exhaustion Asuka was showing, but was unsure what to do.
【Madoka】
Well, don't beat yourself up about it. She kept saying she wanted to push herself, so it was hard to tell her to stop.
【Masaya】
But that's a coach's job.
【Madoka】
Sure, but it's not like you're some veteran with years of experience. No one's expecting you to be perfect.
【Masaya】
......
【Madoka】
Anyway, it was only exhaustion this time, so just consider it a lucky break and learn from this.
【Masaya】
...Will do.
【Madoka】
Okay, that's all for now! I'll call you tomorrow!
【Masaya】
Got it.
【Masaya】
...Man, that was a huge shock.
I should make her take a break from practice.
And I'll use the time before she returns to rethink everything.
If I don't pay more attention to Asuka, something terrible could happen.
The next day.
I tell everyone to go practice, then head to the faculty room by myself.
【Aoi】
How is everyone? Are they doing okay?
【Masaya】
They're practicing as usual. And by usual, I mean on their own. Guess that must feel pretty weird, since we've all been focusing on Asuka lately.
【Masaya】
They appear a little... or, well, a lot more sluggish than usual, though.
【Aoi】
Haha. I see. Well, I'm not surprised.
Aoi-san replies in a matter-of-factly tone.
【Aoi】
So, is that all? You have something else to say, don't you?
Does she watch what I'm doing through our security cameras or what?
Whenever I come to here, she always knows how to cut straight to the heart of my worries.
I take a deep breath to prepare myself to speak.
【Masaya】
I'm planning to make Asuka take a break.
【Aoi】
Really now?
【Masaya】
I pushed her <i>way</i> too hard. It was wrong of me to take her word for it when she said she wanted to practice nonstop.
【Masaya】
That's why... I'm going to tell her to relax a little more from now on.
【Aoi】
......
Aoi-san just stares me in the eye without speaking.
Then...
【Aoi】
Say, Masaya.
【Masaya】
What is it?
【Aoi】
What do you think of Kurashina?
【Masaya】
Well... Asuka is...
Asuka is a very sincere, cheerful girl who loves flying.
She's a fast learner with a whole lot of talent who'll keep practicing until you stop her.
【Masaya】
...I guess that's how I'd describe her.
Aoi-san should know all that, so why is she asking me?
...And more importantly, what's her answer to this question?
【Aoi】
...Is that <i>really</i> all you think?
【Masaya】
Yeah. Or well, that'll all that's worth mentioning right now, anyway.
【Aoi】
She's a monster.
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Aoi】
A monster who's possessed by FC and the sky.
【Aoi】
...Isn't that what you actually think?
What's she trying to say?
【Masaya】
You're going a bit too far there.
【Aoi】
Am I? Didn't you say something similar when Inui showed up here?
【Masaya】
......
I guess I did, yeah.
And that's not all. During the tournament, when I saw the expression on her face as she was watching the final match, a sense of fear struck me.
I really did start to think she was a monster.
【Masaya】
...Yeah, can't say I've never thought that.
Aoi-san forms a smile as she hears me say that.
【Aoi】
Okay, then let me ask you another question. Do you know what Kurashina likes?
【Masaya】
What she likes...?
Um, if I remember correctly...
【Masaya】
Strawberries and... what was it again...? Oh, right, flying fish.
【Aoi】
Good. Now, what does she hate?
【Masaya】
She... hates...
What does she hate? I'm honestly not sure she's mentioned anything specific...
【Aoi】
What about her family?
【Masaya】
I-I think she's an only child.
【Aoi】
What subjects is she good at? What manga does she like?
【Masaya】
Um, uh...
【Aoi】
Where'd she live before moving here? Has she got any special skills? Does she prefer texting or calling? How does she spend her time at home?
【Masaya】
Listen, um...
【Aoi】
...How does she like to be cheered up?
【Masaya】
Ah...!
How am I...
How am I supposed to know any of that?
【Aoi】
I know what you're thinking. It's written all over your face. "How am I supposed to know any of that?"
【Masaya】
No, that's...
【Aoi】
Don't lie to me. I can also tell you thought, "Why is any of that important?"
【Masaya】
...Okay, I admit that did cross my mind.
【Aoi】
I can understand that.
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Aoi】
I mean, I used to feel the exact same way back in the day.
【Aoi】
I thought nothing other than playstyle and special skills that could be used as a weapon mattered.
【Masaya】
So you're saying you've changed your mind?
【Aoi】
That's not important. Listen, I'm trying to say I don't want you to think like me.
【Masaya】
Huh? You're worried about me.
【Aoi】
Yeah.
Aoi-san takes a sip of her coffee.
【Aoi】
If you ask me, you're doing a great job as a coach.
【Masaya】
That sounds pretty fake after what you just said.
【Aoi】
No, trust me, that's normal for a coach. We're not supposed to get too emotionally attached to our players. And in that sense, you pass.
【Aoi】
The problem is that your opponent is Saki Inui.
Saki Inui... What does she have to do with this?
【Masaya】
What's that supposed to mean?
【Aoi】
Exactly what I just said.
【Aoi】
The girl who's serving as her second, Irina... probably knows Saki Inui better than anyone else.
【Aoi】
Her personality, preferences, past, habits, everything. It's impossible to mold such a perfect player unless you take all of that into account.
【Masaya】
Hold on. That sounds like...
In a way that's...
It's even crueler than not knowing.
【Masaya】
You're telling me the only way to beat her is for me to invade Asuka's privacy?
Aoi-san eyes are fixated on me.
She isn't smiling... and her expression isn't a kind one, either.
Oh, I know that look...
It's the same one she had when...
【Aoi】
Do you really think I would tell you to do that?
It's not anger. Honestly, she seems more sad than anything.
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
No, I'm sure you'd never do something like that.
Upon hearing that...
...her expression softens.
【Aoi】
...Thanks.
That's right. How could I have even said that?
I know there's no way she'd tell me to try that.
She's a person who has the utmost faith in me. She's the one who told me she'll always be waiting for me in the sky I've rejected. There's no way she'd try something like that.
【Aoi】
Asuka Kurashina isn't just a member of the Kunahama Academy FC Club. She's also a student in class 2-C who's 12th on the attendance list.
【Aoi】
And you're her classmate, Masaya Hinata, who's 20th on that very same list.
【Masaya】
...Right. And?
【Aoi】
I'm afraid.
【Aoi】
Afraid that you'll wear each other out before you even get to really talk.
【Masaya】
Uh...
Maybe she has a point. To be honest, I know next to nothing about Asuka.
We see each other at practice every day, but the only thing we ever talk about is FC.
I never ask her about her personal life because she's never mentioned it to me.
If she shows no interest in talking about that with me, I don't need to ask. Likewise, I never mention things about my personal life to her either.
【Aoi】
Don't you think it's dangerous to guess Kurashina's thoughts and decide what to do for her when you don't know what she could be thinking?
【Aoi】
I'm afraid it could end up hurting both of you.
【Masaya】
......
I'm speechless.
Asuka was so tired that she fainted. That meant she was pushing herself too hard, which made a break sound like the perfect solution.
And honestly, I'm sure that's still the right call as a coach.
But is that something Asuka <i>actually</i> wants? Is she just supposed to do whatever I say?
And that doesn't just apply to this situation. Talking strategy and trying to develop a weapon for her to use is all pointless if I don't have what she wants in mind while developing them.
【Aoi】
I'm not saying you have to get to know Kurashina in order to win. However, at this rate, both of you will fail.
【Aoi】
Basically, I'm trying to say you should have a little more fun, Masaya.
She's told me to have fun about a million times now.
And yet, she's repeating that phrase again.
【Aoi】
Remember, this is a school club and Kurashina's your classmate. There's no point in any of this if you're not enjoying it.
【Masaya】
...Right.
【Aoi】
Show them the pure joy of flying when you win. I know you two can do it. No, in fact, you're the only ones who can.
That sounds like a tall order...
It's something I wished for after the summer tournament, but I gave up on the idea because it seemed so far out of reach.
But now, I feel like we have to do just that.
【Aoi】
Well, that's my two cents. So, are you going to go visit her now?
【Masaya】
That's the plan.
【Aoi】
Well, you better hurry.
【Masaya】
Got it!
I direct a large bow at her as I answer that question.
Then, I turn around and break into a run.
I don't want her to see the look on my face.
Because I'm sure it's the exact same look I had when I trained with Aoi-san back in the day.
【Aoi】
...I'm sorry, Masaya.
【Aoi】
I don't really have a right to lecture you. Not when I'm trying to make you do something I failed to.
【Aoi】
Still, I know you can do it.
【Aoi】
Don't repeat my mistakes.
【? ? ?】
Yeees!
I hear a voice resound from inside the house after I press the intercom buzzer.
Must be Asuka's mother. She greeted me in that same cheerful voice when I called their landline.
Our club's register has a "Kyoka Kurashina" listed as Asuka's guardian. This is probably her.
【Masaya】
Excuse me, I'm the one who called you earlier. Hinata.
【? ? ?】
Oh, yes, Hinata-kun. Please come in. The door's open.
【Masaya】
Okay, thank you.
【Kyoka】
I'm sorry you had to come all the way out here to check on her.
【Masaya】
Oh no, I should be the one apologizing.
Kyoka-san looks just like Asuka. Or maybe it's more accurate to say she looks like an older version of Asuka. Either way, she's real pretty.
【Kyoka】
She keeps insisting on going to school, so I've had to force her into bed all day.
Her personality also seems like a more mature version of Asuka's.
【Masaya】
...I see.
Yeah. That's easy enough to picture.
【Masaya】
Um, is Asu... I mean, Kurashina-san up?
【Kyoka】
Oh my. You aren't going to use her first name? I heard that's a rule in your club.
【Masaya】
...Huh?
【Kyoka】
It's supposed to boost your morale, right? What a shame. I liked how it made you all feel so close.
【Masaya】
W-Well, doing it outside of school's a little...
【Kyoka】
It's fine, really. In fact, why don't I follow suit and call you Masaya-kun?
【Masaya】
Huh? Oh, sure.
What the hell? She seems to be in complete control of this conversation...
【Kyoka】
Asukaaa, I'm coming in.
【Asuka】
Geez! Cut it out, Mom! I promise not to try to get up again, so...
The moment we enter her room, Asuka starts to mumble those words. But then...
【Asuka】
...Huh?
【Asuka】
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
【Asuka】
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What is Masaya, I mean, Hina... Hinata-kun doing here?!
【Kyoka】
Oh my, I told you he was coming over, didn't I?
【Asuka】
B-But you never said it would be today! Or right now, even!
【Asuka】
...Also, why are you calling him Masaya-kun?
【Kyoka】
Oh, I didn't tell you?
【Asuka】
You didn't!
【Kyoka】
Should I tell him to leave, then?
【Asuka】
Huh?
【Kyoka】
You have a cold, so it's probably best that he doesn't see you anyway.
【Asuka】
......
【Asuka】
W-W-Wait a second!
【Kyoka】
Hehe... There she goes. Cleaning her room even though she hasn't fully recovered.
【Masaya】
Um... I feel like I should probably leave.
【Kyoka】
No, you <i>really</i> shouldn't. I guarantee she's happy to see you.
【Masaya】
I-If you say so...
【Asuka】
Haaah... Haaah... Haaah...
【Asuka】
I-It's fine now. You can come in...
【Kyoka】
Get into your bed, Asuka. Sick people shouldn't be doing strange poses in the middle of their room.
【Asuka】
G-Geez, you know, this is kind of your fault!
Despite her complaints, I can hear her crawling into bed.
【Kyoka】
Well then, I'll excuse myself now. Enjoy!
【Masaya】
Uh, thanks?
In the end, she controlled everything that happened from start to finish.
...Ugh, I need to pull myself together and open the door.
【Masaya】
I'm coming in now.
This is the first time I've entered Asuka's room.
I can't tell if it's normally like this or not, but her room is pretty clean.
Feels a lot more like a girl's room than Misaki's, at any rate.
And all the strawberry-themed items only reinforce that fact.
【Asuka】
U-Um...
【Asuka】
Please don't stare at the things in my room...
【Masaya】
Oh, I-I'm sorry!
I apologize as I shift my gaze to Asuka.
【Asuka】
N-Nice... to see you...
Asuka's lying in her bed with a rather nervous expression on her face.
She looks a bit feverish, though I doubt that's only because of her exhaustion. The sudden clean-up she just did probably made things worse.
【Asuka】
I have to apologize for just now. Mom just suddenly...
【Masaya】
It's fine. I don't really mind.
Asuka's fidgeting about, clearly embarrassed. And honestly, I'm feeling just as embarrassed for an entirely different reason.
I mean... the front of her pajama shirt is wide open. Probably because she still has a fever, but still...
The size of her breasts is making this a pretty sticky situation...
【Masaya】
(I'm not sure where to look...)
Asuka either doesn't realize or doesn't mind, since she's staring at me with an innocent smile on her face.
No, I need to focus. Gotta stop thinking about that before things go south.
【Masaya】
(...Man, I never realized they were so huge.)
Seriously, Masaya?! I literally just told myself <i>not</i> to pay any attention to it!
【Asuka】
Um, Masaya-san?
【Masaya】
Oh! U-Um, uh...
I change the topic in an attempt to save face.
【Masaya】
Y-You seem to have a lot of plushies.
【Asuka】
I like them a lot, so I've been collecting them.
There's a flying fish plushie right next to her pillow.
...Man, what's wrong with me? I mean, who in their right mind would try to start a conversation about plushies?
【Masaya】
S-Say, Asuka...
【Asuka】
Y-Yes!
【Masaya】
How do you, um, spend your time when you're at home?
【Asuka】
H-Huh?
【Masaya】
Well, I mean... what are your hobbies and stuff...
...Ugh, what is wrong with me?! Awkward, much?
She must think I'm a <i>total</i> dork.
Have I always been this bad at striking up a conversation?
I mean, damn, I just asked her about her hobbies out of the blue! What's this supposed to be, some kinda blind date?
【Asuka】
My hobbies? Um, let me think...
【Asuka】
Oh, I love manga! I read lots of them! My dad collects a bunch, too!
【Masaya】
O-Oh. Does that mean you're more into older series?
【Asuka】
That's right. I grew up reading about the power of friendship, fighting for your dreams, and other stuff like that.
【Masaya】
I-I see.
Thank you, Asuka... You're so kind!
She's just rolling with the punches instead of calling me out on my weird questions. What a saint!
【Masaya】
(Wait, this is all wrong!)
Right now, Asuka's no different from how she is with all our classmates at school.
And that's not good enough for me.
【Masaya】
(I want to have a heart-to-heart conversation with Asuka.)
Not about FC or school. I want to speak on an extremely personal level.
But before that...
【Masaya】
Listen, Asuka.
There's something I have to say.
【Asuka】
Yes?
I give her a deep bow as she replied to me.
【Masaya】
I'm so, <i>so</i> sorry!
【Asuka】
What?!
【Masaya】
If I'd been paying more attention, you wouldn't have collapsed.
【Masaya】
I only have myself to blame for not making you take more breaks.
In the end, this is all my fault. She only passed out because I didn't take good care of her.
That's why I need to sincerely apologize for my mistakes.
【Asuka】
It's not like that!
【Masaya】
Huh...?
Asuka shakes her head upon hearing my apology.
【Asuka】
That's not true. This isn't your fault at all!
【Asuka】
It's mine! I felt terrible, but I kept saying I was good to go! How can I blame anyone else when I was keeping the truth from all of you?!
【Masaya】
No, you're wrong! I'm your coach, which means I should have been paying more attention to you.
【Asuka】
Th-That may be true, but I still should have looked after myself better.
【Masaya】
But I should have...
Our eyes meet right as I'm about to continue our argument.
【Asuka】
Pfft...
【Masaya】
Haha...
We both start laughing.
【Asuka】
Ahaha...
【Asuka】
I'm sorry. I get worked up over the weirdest things.
【Masaya】
Not like I'm any better.
I'm a pretty stubborn guy, and it seems Asuka can compete in that regard.
This honestly feels pretty refreshing.
【Masaya】
Asuka.
【Asuka】
Y-Yes.
【Masaya】
Even if we're both to blame here, that doesn't change the fact that I've still got a lot to learn as a coach.
【Asuka】
That's not true. You're already so amazing...
【Masaya】
Not really. Way I see it, I've got a pretty long road ahead of me. And that's why I've decided to try harder from now on.
I look straight at Asuka.
【Masaya】
I wanna spend more time talking to you.
【Asuka】
Y-You want to talk?
【Masaya】
Right.
I recall the point of Aoi-san's message.
I've been seeing Asuka less as a friend and more of an FC player.
That might be the right thing to do as her coach, but thinking back on it, Asuka didn't ask me to train her because she wanted to be the best FC player or anything.
She just wanted to experience the joys of flying.
And I can't believe I forgot something so simple.
That's why I want to get to know Asuka better. Because then, I can coach her more intimately.
Hopefully that's enough to make her the most happy, joyful person in the sky.
【Masaya】
You feeling better at all?
【Asuka】
Yes. My fever's down, so I should be at school tomorrow as long as I rest.
【Masaya】
I see. That's good to hear... I'm looking forward to practicing with you again!
【Asuka】
Y-Yesh... Same here...
Asuka's voice cracks.
God, why does all this feel so awkward?
How am I supposed to get to know her if this keeps up?!
【Masaya】
(Damn it, it's now or never! Time to sink or swim!)
Having made up my mind, I turn to face Asuka.
And when I do, I see that she's pulled a photo album off her shelf.
【Asuka】
Oh, it's kind of dusty. Hold on.
She wipes it down with a tissue.
Let's talk about the past.
It seems our conversation has somehow moved in that direction.
If we don't know anything about each other, then the simplest thing to do is start with our childhoods and go from there.
I agreed with her on that, so she suggested the cliché idea of looking through her photo album together.
【Asuka】
Here, look.
Asuka opens the album.
I stare at the page she's turned to, and get a good look at a picture of her as a kid.
【Asuka】
See, don't I seem a lot different here?
【Masaya】
You really do...
She's wearing a white dress and shares Asuka's features, but that's where the similarities end.
There girl in the picture is casting her gaze down with a frightened look on her face. She gives off a frail, meek impression as she's trying to hide behind a pillar.
It's hard to imagine that's actually Asuka.
【Asuka】
Do you believe me now?
【Masaya】
Believe what?
【Asuka】
When I told you about this, I could tell you didn't buy my story.
【Masaya】
...Really?
I guess I vaguely remember that...
Well, either way, I have no choice but to believe it now.
【Asuka】
You totally did... Well, here's some evidence.
【Masaya】
Yeah... Sorry for doubting you.
【Asuka】
It's fine.
...This conversation is <i>really</i> weird.
【Asuka】
Anyway, I used to be <i>really</i> shy, and I barely ever left the house, but that all changed when I met a certain someone...
【Masaya】
You mean that one girl you told me about before?
【Asuka】
Yes.
【Asuka】
And, well, I changed a lot after I became friends with her.
She turns to the next page as she says that.
【Masaya】
...Huh?
I see a picture of a girl with the exact same hairstyle and face as the last one, but everything else seems different.
She's changed from a dress to a mini skirt and T-shirt. Plus, she seems to be all excited about a beetle she's holding in her hands.
【Masaya】
...That your twin sister?
【Asuka】
People make that joke all the time when they see these.
Asuka's response is accompanied by a smile.
【Asuka】
They're both pictures of me, obviously.
She closes the album as she says that.
【Asuka】
As you can see, something happened to me during my childhood that changed my entire world.
【Masaya】
You can say that again.
Given how drastically she changed, it had to have been something big.
Big enough to say it changed her entire world.
【Asuka】
I made a promise.
【Masaya】
A promise?
Asuka nods.
【Asuka】
A promise with that girl who changed me.
【Asuka】
I promised to always keep facing upward, to always do my best at everything I try, and to always be cheerful.
【Asuka】
Because I didn't want her to be disappointed in me when we met again.
Asuka bursts into a powerful, beaming smile as she says that.
【Asuka】
That's why I never want to give up on anything I've set my mind to.
【Masaya】
I see...
I also have a promise I made with someone when I was a kid.
However, it's now locked away alongside my Grav Shoes.
No matter how strong a promise may be, it will eventually fade.
So how can Asuka remain strong?
How can she not buckle when faced with the harshness of reality?
【Masaya】
Don't you ever get disheartened?
【Asuka】
Huh?
【Masaya】
Losing an FC match, or having practice not go your way. Stuff like that happens all the time.
【Masaya】
Doesn't any of that ever depress you?
I know I'm asking her this question, but I've honestly never seen Asuka react in a negative manner.
Maybe that just means she perceives things differently from most normal people?
And maybe that's part of why I thought she was a monster back then...
【Asuka】
...Masaya-san.
Asuka looks pretty upset as she calls out to me.
【Asuka】
Could it be that you think I'm some sort of freak?
【Masaya】
Uh...
Crap. Was it that obvious?
Asuka takes my silence as confirmation and continues.
【Asuka】
Well, you're wrong. I'm below average in every single way.
【Masaya】
Really?
【Asuka】
Yes. I'm not good at sports, I'm not smart, and I'm pretty indecisive and introverted.
I find that hard to believe.
She's picking up FC like it's no sweat, and her test scores improved leaps and bounds after some studying. That has to mean she's a genius.
There's no other possible explanation, right?
【Asuka】
I've never been good at anything, but luckily, I got something that helped fix my problems.
【Masaya】
The promise with that girl, you mean?
【Asuka】
...Yes.
【Asuka】
Always facing upward. Always trying my best at everything. Always being cheerful. And also, being straightforward when it comes to the things I love.
【Asuka】
I realized I could overcome my weaknesses by sticking to that way of life.
【Asuka】
And that's why I decided that's the one thing I would never give up on.
【Masaya】
......
That's pretty damn impressive.
After all, it's a lot easier to say you'll work hard than actually do it.
Plus, Asuka was well aware that she was starting from the very bottom, which must have made it all the more difficult.
Yeah, that's definitely a type of talent alright.
【Asuka】
Oh, but...
Asuka looks slightly embarrassed as she mumbles those words.
【Asuka】
There are still times when I get discouraged.
【Masaya】
Can't say I've ever seen that.
【Asuka】
Yes, because I try to hide it. Still... it does happen.
I see. So Asuka does worry about things in her life.
And I doubt there are any fields that are exceptions.
Which means...
【Masaya】
Does it happen with FC, too?
I'm honestly afraid to hear her answer.
However, I know I'll never truly understand her until I do.
【Asuka】
...Yes.
Asuka answers my question in a somewhat hesitant voice.
【Asuka】
It only happens very, very rarely, but there are times when I get so upset and frustrated that I don't even want to look at the sky anymore.
My heart pounds against my chest.
Asuka always flies with a smile on her face.
She's so obsessed with the sky that I sometimes wonder if she's a heaven-sent child. Yet <i>even she</i> has those thoughts sometimes...
<i>Even she</i> feels anger strong enough to make her think "I don't want to look at the sky anymore."
I'm shocked.
【Asuka】
But whenever I'm having a hard time, I get help from this little thing.
Asuka pulls off the hairclip she's wearing as she says that.
It's feather-shaped and made out of plastic.
There's nothing special about it. In fact, it even looks kinda cheap.
【Asuka】
That girl gave me this as a present.
【Masaya】
Oh, I see.
That's why she's always got it on.
【Asuka】
If I'm ever in serious trouble, I just need to hold this thing and make a wish. Then, she'll come flying right over to save me.
【Masaya】
Did she tell you that?
【Asuka】
Yes. I've never actually made that wish yet, but... I sometimes touch it as I recall her words.
【Asuka】
I didn't even learn her name in the end, so it's kind of hard to call out to her...
【Masaya】
I see. You don't know her name.
That explains why she hasn't mentioned it yet.
That must be awfully precious to her, since there's nothing else that connects them.
"If you need help, I'll come save you."
The promise itself may be empty, but it serves as an emotional support.
【Masaya】
So it's basically a good luck charm, huh?
【Asuka】
Yes...!
Asuka gives me a firm nod.
【Masaya】
Kids tend to cherish every little thing they own.
【Asuka】
That's true...
【Masaya】
That's why I'm sure you meant a lot to her. Otherwise, she never would've gave it to you.
I'm sure it's become so precious to Asuka <i>because</i> the person gave them something dear to them.
I can relate a little.
【Asuka】
Did you ever have something like this?
【Masaya】
Yeah... I don't remember it well, but I think so.
There is one thing...
But now it's just hidden away in my room, collecting dust.
【Masaya】
I finally understand why you're so strong.
【Asuka】
Are you disappointed by the truth?
【Masaya】
No. If anything, I feel relieved. I respect you a lot, Asuka.
【Asuka】
Huh?
【Asuka】
Wh-What are you saying?! There's nothing respectable about me!
Asuka vehemently denies my claim.
But that won't change my mind.
I finally know Asuka isn't some monster.
She is, without a doubt, a normal human being with weaknesses.
I'm sitting in my room with my lights off, watching TV.
I can't stop thinking about what Asuka mentioned earlier... Things that were dear to me, huh?
【Masaya】
What do I have from my childhood?
There's an old anime airing right now.
"Sky Ruler Zephyrion." If I remember correctly, it's a pretty gory show. Still, I loved it when I was younger.
【Masaya】
I remember begging my parents to buy me a figure until they gave in.
It was a figure of the mech the protagonist piloted. I'm pretty sure I took it with me everywhere.
But eventually, I didn't have it anymore.
And I can't remember what I did with it...
【Masaya】
Yeah, that's how it usually goes...
Cherishing her childhood memories and never going back on the simple promise she made so long ago...
It's honestly kind of crazy that Asuka has managed to do that.
Somehow, she's even turned all her sad experiences into fuel that drives her forward.
And she's still trying to break past her limits to this very day.
【Masaya】
I have to support her.
Man, I should be ashamed of myself. I don't deserve to call myself her coach.
I've got more important things to do right now. I shouldn't be watching old anime in the dark.
【Masaya】
...Do I still have some lingering feelings left inside me?
I get up and pull out my old Grav Shoes.
I don't even remember how many times I've done this before, but this time it's different.
【Masaya】
I think... I want to tell Asuka these words.
The pledge that's engraved onto my Grav Shoes.
When I run my finger over the words, it feels like I'm surrounded by the same sky, wind, and smell as back then.
It's like the memories of the promise I made are rushing back into my mind.
The next day, we immediately start "practice," since Asuka's back to normal.
All of our club members, as well as the people from Takafuji, have gathered.
【Satouin】
...Well then, Masaya Hinata.
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Satouin】
Would you care to explain what's going on?
【Masaya】
Uh, I'm pretty sure I told you in advance that we're not practicing today.
【Satouin】
Yes, I was informed of that, but I interpreted your words as "no physical practice." I was certain you planned on giving a lecture on strategies and techniques instead...
【Satouin】
I never imagined that my precious practice time would be wasted like this!
【Shindou】
Calm down, Satou-kun.
【Satouin】
It's Satouin, President.
【Shindou】
I already made you the new president...
【Satouin】
You're still our "honorary president," so it's fine. At any rate, I demand an explanation as to what this whole fuss is about.
【Rika】
I'm sorry, Satouin-senpai. It's all my fault for inviting you...
【Shindou】
There's nothing to worry about. Takafuji's also been focused on nothing but practice, so I figured this would make for a nice change of pace.
【Satouin】
We are better than the rest <i>because</i> we practice so much! Besides, as the new president, I'm responsible for--
【Shindou】
Yeah yeah, I hear you. Well then, Hinata-kun, see you later.
【Rika】
S-Senpai, I'm so sorry!
【Satouin】
Wait! I have a bone to pick with Masaya Hinata. Hey, don't push me... I told you to stop pushing me!
【Misaki】
Gotta say, I never thought I'd live to see <i>you</i> give us an official Screw Practice Day.
【Masaya】
...The hell's a Screw Practice Day?
Why does she always speak nonsense?
【Misaki】
Huh? I mean, today's a day off from practice, so like, aren't you trying to let us play hooky?
【Masaya】
No! Anyway, where are the others...? Oh, they're finally here.
【Mashiro】
Sorry I'm late.
【Masaya】
...Problems with your Grav Shoes <i>again?</i>
【Mashiro】
No! I wanted to finish a quest before leaving, but the monster took a lot longer to kill than I expected!
【Mashiro】
...Oh!
【Masaya】
Prepare to be punished tomorrow, Mashiro. So, why are the rest of you late?
【Madoka】
My bed held me hostage.
【Madoka】
Ouch!
【Masaya】
Next...! Prez?
【Shion】
I was doing my morning practice, then before I knew it, I was late!
【Masaya】
...It's hard to tell you off when that's your excuse.
【Masaya】
And you, Asuka?
【Asuka】
Um, err, I had so much fun flying that I ended up making a small detour.
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
Okay, so about today...
【Madoka】
Hey! How come you're going easy on Asuka-chan?!
【Mashiro】
Yeah, she's right! That's unfair! I'm going to go complain on the internet!
【Masaya】
Oh no you won't! Just shut up and listen to me!
【Madoka】
Boooooo!
【Mashiro】
Ugh...
I pacify the two unruly girls.
【Masaya】
Look, Asuka's made a full recovery. She's ready to start practicing again.
【Misaki】
Nice. That's a <i>huge</i> weight off my mind.
【Mashiro】
Yaaay!
【Asuka】
Thank you!
【Masaya】
That said...
【Masaya】
...I figured it wouldn't be smart to get right back to our usual practice on the first day.
【Mashiro】
He was never this nice to me after I got injured...
【Madoka】
I know, right? He sure knows how to make us feel like low-tier heroines.
【Masaya】
...Anyway, that's why we're here to enjoy ourselves. Feel free to explore the place.
【Misaki】
Aight, let's go grab some food!
【Mashiro】
Oh, I'll join you!
【Madoka】
Why not check out the place Ichinose-san mentioned? I think she said it was in the food court...
The three of them have scurried off in a matter of seconds.
【Masaya】
They don't waste a single second when it comes to food, huh?
【Asuka】
Um, so what should we do?
【Masaya】
O-Oh... Let's...
【Shion】
Okay! Let's head to the fitness store on the third floor! They have pretty much everything, from the shady stuff you see in infomercials to the real, proper stuff you'll find at gyms, so...
【Shindou】
Okay, you're coming with us, Aoyagi-kun.
【Shion】
Huh?! Wh-What are you doing?! Hey!
【Shindou】
Allow us to borrow Aoyagi-kun for a while.
【Masaya】
Uhhh, okay... Sure.
【Asuka】
They kidnapped Prez.
【Masaya】
They sure did...
【Asuka】
......
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
...Well, should we look around the mall together?
【Asuka】
...Y-Yeah, let's do that.
【Shindou】
Phew... Looks like they set off.
【Misaki】
That was <i>way</i> harder than it had to be. Like, how dense can you be?
【Satouin】
How was I supposed to understand without a proper explanation? I had no idea they were in a romantic relationship...
【Mashiro】
Well, they're not...
【Madoka】
We're helping an awkward coach and an equally awkward girl get to know each other better. Playing cupid, basically.
【Satouin】
That sounds like a romantic relationship to me! Good grief, I can't believe this is why you're all skipping practice...
【Shindou】
You're wrong, Satou-kun.
【Satouin】
It's Satouin. Pray tell, what exactly am I wrong about?
【Shindou】
A player and their second need to establish a deep bond of trust. And that's even more true of a player and their coach.
【Shindou】
Are you trying to claim that's something they can neglect, Satou-kun?
【Satouin】
It's Satouin... Very well, President. I shall accept your explanation.
【Shindou】
Glad to hear it.
【Satouin】
In that case, since I am your second, should we deepen our mutual understanding of each other?
【Shindou】
There's no need for that.
【Satouin】
You're contradicting yourself!
【Misaki】
Ugh, whatever. Who cares! Listen, let's just focus on watching them.
【Shindou】
Good point. Hinata-kun in particular.
【Rika】
I can't wait to see what Asuka-san does...
【Mashiro】
You guys are scaring me. It's starting to sound like you only care about amusing yourselves.
【Shion】
What are you talking about? I, and my muscles, are always honest!
【Madoka】
God, just shut up, Shion!
【Asuka】
What do you think?
【Masaya】
Whoa...
I'm rendered speechless.
Allow me to explain. We entered a clothing store on the second floor because Asuka wanted to try on some clothes.
I was waiting for her in front of the dressing room, thinking to myself how cliché the whole situation was, but she came out wearing something so different from her usual attire that I was stunned.
I mean, she <i>definitely</i> looks cute in it. But the problem is, um...
【Masaya】
(That outfit's <i>way</i> too revealing! I mean, her chest's basically popping out of it!)
【Asuka】
Oh, it doesn't look good on me. I see... Should've known I couldn't pull it off.
【Masaya】
Th-That's not it!
【Asuka】
Huh?
I-I've gotta say something!
Just need to think of a way to mention it without specifically talking about her chest...
As they say, honesty's the best policy.
【Masaya】
U-Um... it looks good on you. Like, <i>really</i> good.
【Asuka】
Y-You mean it? To be honest, it's a little embarrassing to hear that... I mean, it's showing a lot of skin...
I almost remind her that the flight suit is even worse, but quickly decide it's a bad idea. Don't want her getting all nervous when she has it on.
【Masaya】
Don't worry. You look real cute, I swear!
【Asuka】
I-I see... Thank you...
We're both acting <i>really</i> shy right now.
【Masaya】
A-Any other clothes you wanna try on?
【Asuka】
Oh, I like this outfit the most, so I want to check it from different angles.
【Masaya】
Well, in that case...
I move my gaze downwards and spot an awfully short skirt.
【Masaya】
Ah...!
I hurriedly avert my eyes.
【Asuka】
I think I'm starting to get used to it... Yeah, it really does look cute on me!
Asuka spins around on the spot and checks how she looks from behind.
【Masaya】
(S-Stop it, Asuka!)
Her skirt floats up, and to make matters worse, her breasts start jiggling.
【Asuka】
Hmhmhmm... Hmhmhmm....
Asuka flashes a radiant smile as she starts humming.
I'm rooted to the spot with a cramped smile on my face.
【Masaya】
(I-I won't deny that this is a great view, but it feels more like a hard test than anything right now...)
【Misaki】
...Man, couldn't he have been a little more smooth there?
【Mashiro】
Knowing him, he probably thought something corny like, "honesty's the best policy."
【Shindou】
I never imagined Hinata-kun would make that face...
【Satouin】
Allow me to be frank, President. You're starting to scare me.
【Madoka】
Wow, he just took advantage of the moment and touched! What a perv!
【Misaki】
Huh? You serious? I missed that! Come on, do it again, Masaya!
【Shion】
Yeah! I don't really get what's going on, but go ahead, Hinata!
【Rika】
Guys...
【Masaya】
Here, for you.
【Asuka】
Wow, thank you so much!
It's fried chicken from the place Ichinose mentioned the last time we were here.
She said the stall was still open, so I made sure not to pass up on this opportunity.
【Masaya】
They're freshly fried, so eat them while they're hot!
【Asuka】
Then I'll start right away!
Asuka throws some fried chicken into her mouth.
【Asuka】
Hot! Hot...! Uggghhh!
【Masaya】
Well, yeah, you're not really supposed to throw the whole thing into your mouth like that...
I literally just told her they were freshly fried...
Guess she focused too hard on the "eat them while they're hot" part.
【Asuka】
Ah, ah... Mmm... Mmm...
At first, Asuka's screaming because of the heat, but her expression starts to morph with every single bite.
【Asuka】
Mmm... Wow!
【Asuka】
Delicious!
She seems overjoyed by now.
【Masaya】
Glad you like it. I got a whole bag for you, so dig in.
I hand Asuka her bag, then open my own.
【Asuka】
Thanks!
Asuka snacks on another piece of fried chicken with a satisfied expression on her face.
【Asuka】
They're <i>really</i> delicious, but...
For some reason, she looks conflicted.
【Masaya】
What, you don't like fried chicken?
【Asuka】
N-No, I love it!
【Asuka】
It's just, something's been bothering me...
She shows me the paper bag as she says that.
There's a chicken on it with the phrase "Chickenlicious!" in a word bubble coming from its mouth.
【Masaya】
What about it?
【Asuka】
Huh? It doesn't bother you?
Asuka stares at me, seemingly confused.
【Asuka】
I mean, it feels wrong that the chicken's calling itself yummy...
【Masaya】
...What?
【Asuka】
You see, I love flying fish, so if I ever saw one jump out of the water and say, "I'm delicious!" I would be <i>totally</i> grossed out!
【Asuka】
That's why bags like these, or ones that say "Moolicious" or "Oinklicious," don't feel right to... Hey, why are you laughing, Masaya-san?!
【Masaya】
...Huh? You weren't cracking a joke?
I thought she was just trying to get me to laugh...
【Asuka】
No! I! Was! Not! Those are my honest feelings! In fact, I'm so serious that I'd ban it if I could!
【Masaya】
O-Okay, I'm sorry...
【Asuka】
Geez...
【Misaki】
Lame. They're still stuck on small talk.
【Mashiro】
Yeah, Masaya-senpai's <i>really</i> bad at holding interesting conversations.
【Misaki】
Yep, it's all his fault. He <i>totally</i> should've said, "I wanna snack on you instead of this fried chicken!" What a loser!
【Madoka】
What are you, a perverted old man?
【Shindou】
I think this is going well. I was a little worried, but they're actually holding a normal conversation.
【Satouin】
That's certainly true. In fact, it almost makes me think monitoring them was unnecessary.
【Rika】
U-Um...!
【Madoka】
What's wrong, Ichinose-san?
【Rika】
I-I'm going to go get myself a bag of fried chicken!
【Madoka】
Huh? Hey, wait, Ichinose-saaan!
【Shion】
She's already gone...
【Satouin】
It's unusual for her to just run off like that without waiting for consent...
【Shindou】
I suppose it's best to split up here, then.
【Misaki】
Right. Guess we'll go our separate ways.
【Shion】
Okay, I'll drop by the muscle shop.
【Madoka】
It sounds pretty gross when you call it a muscle shop... What are you two gonna do?
【Misaki】
Hm... Let's head out, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Okay! I'll follow you to the ends of the Earth!
【Satouin】
What about you, President?
【Shindou】
I'm going home.
【Satouin】
I see you've lost all interest the moment this outing has stopped being about Masaya Hinata...
【Shindou】
I heard that, Satou-kun.
【Satouin】
It's Satouin.
【Masaya】
I think we've explored the whole place by now.
We've walked around all the floors, so a lot of time has passed.
【Asuka】
Um... Masaya-san.
Asuka comes to a sudden stop.
【Masaya】
Yeah?
【Asuka】
Thank you for today.
Then, she bows her head and thanks me.
【Asuka】
You were worried because of what I said yesterday, right?
She caught on, huh?
She seemed a little sad when she was talking about her past, which was very unusual for her.
And that's why I was hoping the mall would cheer her up.
Guess I've still got a lot to learn... A real gentleman would've been a lot more subtle to keep her from ever noticing.
【Masaya】
You don't have to thank me. I just figured it'd be nice to go have fun for a day.
【Asuka】
Still, I'm happy that you're worried about me.
【Masaya】
...You're welcome.
Well, it's fine as long as she appreciates the thought.
【Masaya】
You know, that's not my only reason... There's actually something I wanna show you.
【Asuka】
Oh?
【Masaya】
Yeah... Figured it must be open by now.
I look at the map on the wall as I say that.
Last time I was here, there was an "under construction" sticker that mentioned the roof was off limits.
【Masaya】
Nice, it's gone.
However, now there's just a name in its place.
【Masaya】
Okay, let's go.
【Asuka】
Uh, where?
【Masaya】
The rooftop.
【Asuka】
Huh...? The rooftop?
I enter the elevator with Asuka.
Once I press the "R" button, the elevator starts to rise.
【Masaya】
Okay, we're here.
The doors slide open and we're greeted by dazzling light.
【Asuka】
Wow...!
Asuka sounds downright amazed.
Iron Mall's rooftop has been under reconstruction for a long time.
But before that, it was a famous attraction that represented the whole area.
And that only happened because it provided the best view on the island. No matter where you look, the deep blue sky stretches out endlessly.
That's why everyone calls it the Skywall.
No one knows how it started, but eventually, everyone was using that name.
【Masaya】
Oh, they kept the fence out of the way...
The roof used to be surrounded by a fence for security purposes.
However, it seems to now be on a lower section. Smart, since that keeps it from obstructing anyone's view.
【Masaya】
Gotta thank Satouin-san's family for this.
The sight's even more beautiful than my rose-tinted memories.
【Masaya】
It's amazing, isn't it, Asu...
I start talking to her, but then realize she's standing with her arms spread out.
【Masaya】
......
Is she trying to feel the wind with her body? No, wait, maybe she's being overwhelmed by the desire to take off from here?
Whatever the case, it's clear that she's loving the view, since she's taking in deep breaths as her gaze wanders.
【Asuka】
Ahhh...
Asuka lets out a wistful sigh as she keeps stretching out her body.
【Asuka】
Huh? Oh, Masaya-san...
【Masaya】
Yeah?
【Asuka】
Um, did you just talk to me?
She looks kind of embarrassed. Guess she didn't hear me.
【Masaya】
Yeah, I did.
【Asuka】
I knew I didn't just imagine it! Sorry I ignored you!
【Asuka】
It's just, this view is so beautiful that I tuned everything else out.
Figured.
【Masaya】
It's fine, really. I'm just glad you like it.
【Asuka】
Oh, I don't like it! I <i>love</i> it!
【Asuka】
I didn't know there was something this amazing here... I'm <i>definitely</i> going to visit again!
I'm sure Satouin-san would be thrilled by the glowing praise.
【Asuka】
It's making me want to start flying right this instant.
【Masaya】
Hm?
【Asuka】
I'm sure if saw this when I first moved here, I would've wanted to fly even without Grav Shoes.
Right. That's normal.
【Masaya】
You know, this place was already here when I was a kid.
【Asuka】
Oh, you mean before the reconstruction?
【Masaya】
Yeah. Back then, there was a fence that went <i>way</i> higher...
I point around at various areas as I revisit my memories with her.
【Masaya】
There was a hot dog stand over there.
【Masaya】
Hang gliding was still popular, so you could see people flying over in that direction. They kinda looked like paper planes from this distance...
Blue doesn't fade.
In fact, it feels like that color's right next to me.
My memories are starting to return in vivid colors as I speak to Asuka.
【Masaya】
And this... was my special spot.
We're at the very center of the roof.
【Masaya】
Look up.
【Asuka】
Huh? You mean from here?
【Masaya】
Sure do.
Asuka follows my instructions.
【Asuka】
Wow...
【Asuka】
It's completely blue!
【Masaya】
Yep. It was the sky I kept all to myself.
Gazing up at the boundless sky from this spot always used to fill me with joy.
Though, that didn't mean I wanted to stay there forever or anything. The place actually made me want to take off and fly as far as possible. It made me want to travel beyond the sky.
And then, my dad took me along to my first FC tournament.
That was the start of everything. Thanks to that seemingly insignificant trip, I started to admire the person who could soar faster and higher than anyone else.
【Masaya】
That was why I got so obsessed with FC. Learning I could actually fly through the sky changed everything.
I begged my dad to let me become a Grav Shoe beta tester.
And when that worked out, I was flying through the sky nonstop.
【Masaya】
I really loved it.
The sky, her... and also FC.
Back then, I had no doubts in my mind. I was sure there was no one who could reach the same heights as me.
"With these, I can go anywhere!"
"I can be the first to travel beyond the sky!"
I sincerely believed that.
【Masaya】
...And yet, I ended up turning my back on the sky.
The blue world beyond the sky was stolen from me.
My outstretched hand attempted to grab at it, but... nothing remained in my palm.
【Asuka】
Ah...!
Asuka was just silently listening to my story, so that's her first reaction.
Honestly, when I see the sky reflected in her eyes, I'm tempted to continue and tell her all the things I'd rather keep to myself.
【Masaya】
That's why...
I turn to Asuka with a smile on my face.
【Masaya】
...I don't want you to ever experience the same painful things I did.
【Masaya】
I don't want to see you fall out of love with flying, so please remember how you felt when you first looked up at the sky from this spot.
【Masaya】
I brought you here to burn that sight into your mind...
【Asuka】
Really?
I give her a firm nod.
【Masaya】
Turn to the sky, and don't avert your eyes. The answer lies there.
【Asuka】
Huh?
【Masaya】
Those are the words engraved on my old Grav Shoes.
Aoi-san wrote that after I managed to win my first junior tournament.
I begged her to do it, and she eventually gave in.
【Masaya】
When you're having a hard time and don't know what to do, look up at the sky, and don't turn your eyes away. If you do, you'll find an answer soon enough. Get it?
【Asuka】
Turn to the sky, and don't avert your eyes. The answer lies there...
【Asuka】
Saying it is enough to fill me with energy.
【Masaya】
Yeah... they're pretty powerful words.
Unfortunately, I didn't follow that advice.
And Aoi-san had a sad look on her face when I turned my gaze away from the sky and said farewell to her.
Even now, I tend to think about that moment when I see Aoi-san's face. The pain still lingers in my chest.
【Asuka】
I don't want to look down ever again.
Asuka says that while she's looking up at the sky.
【Asuka】
I was always unhappy when I walked around with my eyes on the ground.
【Asuka】
So, from now on, I'll look to the sky.
【Asuka】
I'll keep looking at the sky and... believe...
【Masaya】
...Good.
A chirping flock of seagulls is flying toward the mountains.
Thin clouds on the mountain range get blown away by the wind.
With all the white completely gone, the sky's dominated by blue.
And Asuka and I stare off into this clear, blue world.
We're staring somewhere beyond the sky.
【Masaya】
What's taking everyone so long?
【Asuka】
Oh, Misaki-chan just sent me a text.
【Masaya】
What's it say?
【Asuka】
Um, "We don't wanna be third wheels, so we're heading back. Oh, just remembered that udon noodles from Shikoku are on sale. Get me about five bags."
【Masaya】
......
【Asuka】
They left...
【Masaya】
Those guys...
You know what, I'll ruin her day by getting cold soba noodles instead of what she asked for.
Though, maybe she'd like that too...
【Masaya】
Well, whatever. Let just head home.
【Asuka】
U-Um, Masaya-san.
I turn to face Asuka when I hear her call out to me.
【Asuka】
Can we... take a little detour on the way back?
【Masaya】
A detour?
【Asuka】
Yes!
【Asuka】
What do you say, Masaya-saaan!
【Masaya】
You're looking good!
Asuka's flying a bit behind me.
【Asuka】
Look at this! We're flying together!
Asuka's facing upward as she flies just barely above the water's surface.
There's a school of flying fish right by her that are jumping about.
She narrows her eyes every time some water hits her, but other than that, Asuka seems extremely happy.
【Asuka】
I found this place on the way to the mall. It took everything I had to keep myself from flying with them.
【Asuka】
Then, when I saw the sky up on the rooftop, I lost control.
【Masaya】
Can't blame you for that.
We're currently a short way from Fukuru Island.
This area, which is currently sparkling thanks to the sun beating down on the water, is a known fishing ground.
【Masaya】
(Why's she acting all embarrassed?)
Hm, maybe it's normal to get embarrassed when you're talking about things you like.
【Masaya】
Did I lay it on a little too thick earlier?
I tend to get <i>really</i> excited when I talk about the sky or FC...
【Asuka】
Masaya-saaan!
【Masaya】
What's up?
Asuka shouts my name again.
It turn to her and spot an even bigger smile than before on her face.
【Asuka】
I really am in love!
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
...Huh?
Wh-What's she saying?!
【Asuka】
I'm in love with...
【Asuka】
...flying through the sky!
【Masaya】
Oh...
I see. That's what she meant.
I mean, that was real obvious. What was I expecting?
【Asuka】
I'm going to cherish those words!
【Masaya】
...I see.
【Asuka】
Turn to the sky, and don't avert your eyes.
【Masaya/Asuka】
The answer lies there.
【Masaya】
The answer lies there.
【Asuka】
The answer lies there.
Asuka continues to fly alongside the flying fish.
There's no sense of obligation, responsibility, or pressure here. She's just having fun.
I can't let this pure, innocent girl suffer the same setback I did.
【Masaya】
Turn to the sky, and don't avert your eyes...
【Masaya】
Enjoy it to your heart's content...
I twist the phrase that defined my childhood.
And sure, that's mostly meant for Asuka, but...
【Masaya】
Gotta make sure I enjoy it, too...
The horizon is slowly dyed orange.
I turn toward Asuka and quietly repeat those words as I take in the look of utter joy on her face.
【Misaki】
Asuka did great out there. I think she's back to normal.
【Masaya】
Agreed. She's a lot better at keeping up with stuff than she was a few days ago.
Her nimble movements clearly show that she's fully recovered.
【Masaya】
Makes you realize how important it is to enjoy yourself.
【Misaki】
Yeah, I know <i>exactly</i> what you mean. I'm having the time of my life whenever I eat.
【Masaya】
Why don't you try redirecting some of that to FC?
【Misaki】
Ahaha. I'll leave that to Asuka. No way I can compete with her.
Guess that's true...
【Madoka】
Heeey, Hinata-kun!
【Masaya】
What's up? They're not done yet, are they?
Shindou-san's supposed to be sparring with Asuka for another ten minutes.
It's too early for it to be over.
【Madoka】
That's not it. Ms. Kagami just called. She wants to see you.
【Masaya】
Oh, okay. Guess I'll head to the faculty room.
【Madoka】
Actually, for some reason, she wants to meet you at Shirase-san's store.
【Masaya】
Really?
【Misaki】
Wow, you get to leave early? You lucky dog.
【Masaya】
It's not like I'm gonna go fool around.
I wonder what this is about...
We just had that whole conversation about Asuka the other day... Could it be about her?
【Shirase】
Oh, there you are.
【Aoi】
Sorry for calling you all the way out here in the middle of practice.
【Masaya】
Don't worry about it... So, did something happen?
【Aoi】
...You could say that. Whip it out, Hayato.
【Shirase】
Sure thing.
Shirase-san pulls out a laptop after he says that.
【Shirase】
You know it's time for the nationals, right?
Obviously.
Shindou-san's normally our region's representative.
But this time, Saki Inui's taking his place.
【Shirase】
Well, the results are out.
【Masaya】
I see. Forgot the grand finals were today. So, who won?
I haven't been keeping up with it.
Partially because it's on a remote island that's south of Kyushu, which makes it hard to keep track. Though, the main reason is that I'm sure I know how it'll turn out.
【Shirase】
Saki Inui. She crushed the competition. Her opponent didn't manage to take the lead even once.
【Masaya】
...I see.
I knew what he was going to say, but that doesn't soften the blow at all.
Honestly, I kind of wanted her to win, since she beat Shindou-san and all. Still, I'm in awe at her dominant display.
【Aoi】
The problem is <i>how</i> she won.
【Masaya】
Huh? What do you mean?
【Shirase】
See for yourself.
Instead of answering my question, Shirase-san simply points at his laptop's screen.
On it, I see a recording of a local TV channel from the area the nationals took place.
【Masaya】
Is this Inui's match?
【Shirase】
It is.
【Masaya】
Sweet. This'll be a huge help.
Inui's been destroying videos of her matches for a while now, so it's hard to find any tape on her.
Luckily, this tournament just took place, so she probably hasn't had a chance to scrub the recordings... Man, good thing we have Shirase-san in our corner.
【Shirase】
Yeah, you'd assume that. The problem is...
Shirase-san trails off as he plays the video.
Inui and her opponent appear on screen.
There are some subtitles that display the players' schools and names, too, but they look pretty cheap.
【Masaya】
Oh, he's...
I think I've seen him on FC fansites...
【Aoi】
He's Iwate Prefecture's representative, Asami Tadahiko. And up until the grand finals, he swept all of his opponents.
Oh, now I remember. He's a pretty famous player in northeastern Japan.
His home is an area full of mountains, but he's among the best despite that handicap, which has earned him the nickname "Child of Ria."
He's so good that he's never failed to make the nationals.
【Masaya】
If I remember correctly, he put up a good fight against Shindou-san last year.
【Aoi】
How do you think Inui faced a player of his caliber?
【Masaya】
Huh? Um...
Well, she'd jump to the second line, then use that disgusting Bird Cage to...
【Masaya】
...Did she use a different style?
【Aoi】
Watch.
I look at the screen.
【Masaya】
Seriously?!
This can't be...
In the video, she's racing straight toward second.
And after that, she soars right to third.
【Masaya】
Um, this is...
It's nothing like her usual playstyle.
【Masaya】
She's playing like a normal Speeder...
From first to second, then second to third...
Inui's competing in the most straightforward manner imaginable.
【Aoi】
Exactly. She competed in the nationals as a Speeder.
【Aoi】
You do realize what that means, right?
【Masaya】
Yeah... I think I do.
I'm pretty sure Saki Inui chooses her playstyle based on her opponent.
Which means she only showed off her playstyle that destroys the regular conventions of FC because she acknowledged Shindou-san's skill.
The nationals may have technically been more important, but there was no one there as good as him, so she didn't take it seriously. God, I feel bad for her opponents...
She was trying to win while concealing her secrets, and it worked.
【Shirase】
There you have it. I've been trying to get my hands on data to help you, but yeah...
【Aoi】
Our opponent is a lot stronger than we imagined.
【Masaya】
It's fine, really... Thanks.
I understand why they called me out here.
Knowing that our opponent is so thorough is helpful in its own way.
Our goal is to win while enjoying ourselves... Unfortunately, that just seems harder and harder every time I learn something new about our opponent.
【Shirase】
Hm, you don't look all that scared or depressed.
【Aoi】
Yeah, you're actually grinning instead, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Really? Well, I am kinda fired up...
Not knowing a thing about our opponent is terrifying, but I can't let that drag us down.
It's better to just look forward to the challenge.
I can't stop thinking about how to gather information on Saki Inui as I walk back home.
At the end of the day, more information can't hurt. Like, it would <i>really</i> help if we knew how she practiced.
Unfortunately, I doubt Shirase-san's contacts will dig up anything. Plus, the internet's a total bust.
【Masaya】
What to do...
It's hard to resist the temptation to find out more about the enemy before us.
However, all the information is shrouded in a thick curtain.
【Masaya】
(I've gotta come up with something...)
I just have to.
【Minori】
Hey, quit rushin'! We're gonna get caught if ya get carried away and walk too far!
【Masaya】
Which way should I go?
【Minori】
Oh, you've gotta turn left... Man, can't say I expected you to go with my plan!
【Masaya】
Don't say that! I'm not doing this because I want to!
【Asuka】
C-Calm down...
In the end, I wandered about aimlessly after I failed to come up with a way to gather information on Saki Inui.
And Hosaka just so happened to appear right before I got home.
【Masaya】
I was doomed the moment I told her what I was thinking... Can't believe I let her blackmail me into this...
【Minori】
Hey, Coach! Your thoughts are leakin'!
【Masaya】
...I won't show you any mercy if Asuka ever sees that video.
【Minori】
No worries, Coach! Journalists <i>always</i> keep their word.
I find that hard to believe when it's coming from someone who's willing to resort to blackmail.
【Masaya】
Anyway, why'd you involve Asuka? She's got nothing to do with this. I don't want her to get into any trouble...
【Asuka】
Oh, I asked her to let me tag along.
【Masaya】
Huh? R-Really?
【Asuka】
Yes... I'm willing to do anything to see how Inui-san practices.
【Minori】
See, it's not my fault!
【Masaya】
Uh, no, it <i>totally</i> is. You shouldn't have told her about any of this...
【Minori】
What's the big deal? Oh, you've gotta turn right, then just keep walkin' straight.
【Masaya】
Yeah, whatever.
I'm blaming everything on you if we get caught, Hosaka.
【Minori】
We're here. This is Kairyou's practice facility.
【Masaya】
This place? Damn, it's got a roof and everything...
【Asuka】
It's amazing...
We finally spot Kairyou's practice facility once we get out of the woods.
It's like a baseball stadium with a dome.
【Minori】
It's to protect her from the weather. She can practice in there rain or shine, so it's one of her secret weapons.
【Masaya】
Makes sense. Plus, there's no danger of any secrets leaking thanks to the dome.
【Minori】
Bingo! They're tryin' to keep pests like us out.
【Minori】
...Try to keep your voice down. They ain't gonna let us leave peacefully if we get caught.
【Masaya】
Uh, what...? You know what, forget it. I'll just keep my voice down.
【Asuka】
Understood. I'll be very quiet...
【Minori】
'Kay, then let's take a look. I found a spot that gives ya the best view of what's goin' on inside.
I follow her instructions and peer inside.
【Minori】
Wonder what they're up to...
【Masaya】
Here goes nothing... Oh, there she is.
【Asuka】
Yes, I see her... too.
【Asuka】
That's...
Asuka's alarmed by what she sees.
【Masaya】
Ah...
And honestly, so am I.
Inui's engaging in a dogfight.
Which is all fine and dandy, but the way she's doing it is abnormal.
【Asuka】
She's doing the same three versus one practice as me!
That's right. Inui's practice is a lot like our own.
【Masaya】
Man, she's got some insanely good opponents...
【Minori】
You can say that again.
【Asuka】
Are they that amazing?
【Masaya】
...We have Johansson from Finland, Chapman from England, and last, but certainly not least, the runner-up of last year's Europe Championship, Greiner from Germany.
【Asuka】
Huh? Um, what kind of players are they?
【Minori】
Lemme explain.
【Minori】
Lumikki Johansson is a Finnish player who won the Europe Junior Championship in her school days. Her incredibly agile play has earned her the title "Scandinavian Gale."
【Minori】
Then, we have the English player, Eric Chapman. Everyone thinks he'll be the next big thing. He's feared for his playstyle of never letting his opponent out of his grasp, which reminds people of a snake with its teeth sunk into its prey.
【Minori】
And finally, there's the best of the bunch. The German player, Gerhard Greiner. Because of his initials and his skills, he's called "The Big GG." Like Coach just said, he came in second at the Europe Championship last year.
【Asuka】
S-So they're all strong pros?!
【Minori】
Yep. Plus, they're all from Europe, which normally dominates FC, so it's weird to see them in Japan.
Yeah, this is a mindblowing lineup.
They're players I've only ever seen on TV and the internet. Hell, even Aoi-san only ever met them once or twice, and she played professionally overseas.
Yet, they're allowing themselves to be used as pawns. And to make matters worse, they're all going at her at the same time, which means they're basically admitting they stand no chance against her.
【Masaya】
This is...
【Minori】
Not surprised that you're kinda scared. Just don't let it get to...
【Masaya】
...<i>really</i> exciting, isn't it, Asuka?
I look at Asuka as I finish my sentence.
【Asuka】
Yes! Their movements are incredible! Plus, Inui-san looks so cool out there!
【Masaya】
Totally!
It's easy to give in to fear.
However, there's no real point burdening yourself with that pressure, since that'll just weigh you down.
In fact, it's more important to have the exact opposite mindset. Getting excited about a challenge is a far better path to victory.
...I finally get it now, Aoi-san.
【Minori】
Well, that ain't the reaction I expected...
【Minori】
......
【Minori】
Guess that's just how it's gonna go.
Inui keeps running through this superhuman level of practice.
And, as we observe it all, sighs keep escaping our lips.
However, they aren't sighs of resignation.
Instead, they're born out of a sense of admiration, as well as a desire to join in on the fun.
【Minori】
It's a lil' late now, huh?
【Asuka】
Thanks for your help, Minori-chan!
【Minori】
Don't sweat it. Just hope this was useful.
【Asuka】
It was!
【Asuka】
Masaya-san, let's give it our best shot tomorrow!
【Masaya】
Sure thing. Later.
I wave at Asuka as she heads on home.
【Minori】
Um, Coach...
【Masaya】
What?
Hosaka pulls out a memory card with a serious expression on her face.
【Minori】
I'm lettin' ya have this.
【Masaya】
...What's on it?
【Minori】
All the pics I have of Saki Inui. Got 'em while I was diggin' for scoops. Don't go passin' 'em around, ya hear?
【Masaya】
Huh? But aren't these...
She must have spent a long time gathering these for her articles...
【Minori】
Well, duh, they're important to me! That's why I'm tellin' ya to be careful!
【Masaya】
G-Got it... But why share them with me now?
I hope this isn't another harebrained scheme she's cooked up to manipulate me...
【Minori】
I'm excited.
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Minori】
I'm dyin' to see Asuka-senpai beat that emotionless "Monarch of the Skies" with a smile on her face. That's the kinda picture I want in my articles!
【Masaya】
Hosaka, you...
【Minori】
Call me if ya ever need any help, Coach! I'll do what I can to help make it a fair fight!
【Minori】
Well, that's all I've got for now! Catch ya later!
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
I'll put this to good use, Hosaka.
【Avalon Employee】
...The intruders watched the entire practice session, then swiftly made their escape through the woods and returned home.
【Irina】
I see.
【Avalon Employee】
How should we deal with them? Do you want us to contact their school to get them punished?
【Irina】
No, that won't be necessary. Nothing they saw is all that damaging.
【Avalon Employee】
U-Understood.
【Irina】
Is there anything else to report?
【Avalon Employee】
There is one thing... I observed them the entire time and the Kunahama students, um...
【Irina】
What is it?
【Avalon Employee】
They appeared... excited. Like, they didn't seem shocked in any way.
【Irina】
......
【Avalon Employee】
Oh, I'm sorry for reporting such an irrelevant detail.
【Irina】
No, that information is quite valuable... Thank you.
【Avalon Employee】
I-It's my pleasure!
【Irina】
You may take your leave now.
【Avalon Employee】
Understood! Excuse me!
【Irina】
......
【Irina】
You're quite naive, Masaya Hinata.
【Irina】
Perhaps it's finally time to have a proper chat with him...
【Masaya】
Okay, this is your chance, Asuka! Rush in from the side!
【Asuka】
Got it!
【Shindou】
Ugh...! Not bad, Kurashina-kun!
【Masaya】
Nice! You made him give up some ground. Now, drive him down and corner him!
【Asuka】
Understood!
【Misaki】
Damn... This is amazing.
【Madoka】
I can't believe she's even overwhelming Shindou-san now...
【Mashiro】
It's hard for me to even follow her with my eyes at this point.
【Shion】
Really? I don't have a problem keeping up.
【Madoka】
Wow, I can't believe being a speed freak is actually coming in handy!
【Rika】
Come to think of it, Hinata-san joined in on the practice a few days ago as Asuka's second, didn't he?
【Misaki】
Right. Said he wanted to get used to it before the fall tournament.
【Rika】
Huh? But there's still a lot of time left...
【Misaki】
Yeah. Kinda just feels like they're both excited.
【Madoka】
Maybe it's thanks to that spying they did the other day?
【Rika】
Oh, okay...
【Misaki】
Huh? What's this sound?
【Mashiro】
Someone's ringtone? But it's not mine...
【Madoka】
Oh, sorry. It's mine.
【Madoka】
Never fear, Madoka-chan's here! Oh, Ms. Kagami? Hi.
【Misaki】
It's Madoka's, huh?
【Rika】
What kind of ringtone is that?
【Madoka】
Yeah, Hinata-kun's in the middle of practice right now... Huh? Wait, what?!
【Madoka】
Okay, I'm on it. I'll let him know.
【Misaki】
Something wrong?
【Mashiro】
Sure sounds like it...
【Madoka】
Yeah, I'm a little surprised.
【Rika】
Did something happen?
【Madoka】
Hinata-kun has a visitor.
【Madoka】
And it's the person he wants to see least right now...
【Misaki】
Hm?
【Masaya】
I haven't been up here in a long time...
I'm at a large garden that's located on the roof of our main school building.
It's a pretty popular spot, so it gets real crowded at lunch.
I eat lunch in our clubroom and head to practice right after school, so I never have the time, or a good reason, to visit the place.
That's why I haven't been up here in nearly a year.
【Masaya】
I finally get to see it again, but she has to be here to kill the mood...
I approach the person who's waiting for me near the back of the garden.
【Masaya】
Sorry I kept you waiting.
She has the same friendly smile on her face as the last time I met her...
【Irina】
Oh no, I haven't waited.
Irina-san greets me with those words.
This is her second visit to Kunahama.
Compared to her grand entrance last time, this is rather anticlimactic.
However, that actually makes things worse, since I can't even guess at her motives.
【Masaya】
(Does she want another practice match?)
No way I'll agree to that.
【Masaya】
(I won't let her try to break Asuka's spirit...)
I calm my breathing and face this monster before me.
She seems a lot larger than her actual height. Guess that just goes to show how intimidating she is...
【Masaya】
What brings you here today?
I open the conversation with the main question on my mind.
【Irina】
First of all, I want to apologize for last visit.
【Masaya】
Apologize...? You mean for challenging us to a practice match without any prior notice?
【Irina】
Yes, that's right. That was far too abrupt. It was very rude of me, so I deeply regret it.
Irina-san lowers her head as she says that.
【Irina】
I apologize for my actions... I hope you can forgive me.
...Why do I feel so uneasy when she's just delivering an apology?
Maybe it's just because she's hard to deal with in general, but I've been feeling this dull ache in my body ever since I got up here...
【Masaya】
Don't worry about it. I'm not holding it against you or anything. So, is that all?
I doubt it, but a man can dream.
Maybe I'll get off easy.
【Irina】
No.
Irina-san slowly raises her head again, at which point I find the same friendly smile as always plastered on her face.
【Irina】
Let us talk about the main reason I'm here, Masaya Hinata.
【Masaya】
Ah...!
【Madoka】
Excuse me.
【Aoi】
Oh, younger Aoyagi. Is practice over?
【Madoka】
Yeah. Everyone's already left but Asuka-chan. She's going to wait around for Hinata-kun to get back.
【Aoi】
Haha... She's a pretty devoted girl.
【Madoka】
Ms. Kagami...
【Aoi】
Something wrong? That scary look <i>really</i> doesn't suit your face.
【Madoka】
Why did you let her meet Hinata-kun?
【Aoi】
Oh, it's about that.
【Madoka】
It's obvious that she's up to no good...
【Madoka】
Asuka-chan's finally in the right state of mind. If Irina-san pulls something weird again, we might drop back to square one.
【Madoka】
You should know that, so why...
【Aoi】
Trespassing.
【Madoka】
Ah...!
【Aoi】
She said she'd forget about them trespassing on her school's grounds if I let her meet him, so I had no choice.
【Madoka】
Oh...
【Aoi】
You knew, didn't you? Not good, Ms. Manager. You should've reported that to me immediately.
【Madoka】
I'm sorry... Nothing happened, so we figured they didn't notice.
【Aoi】
Well, don't worry about it. Honestly, I expected him to pull something like that sooner or later.
【Madoka】
But... what'll we do if they mess with Asuka-chan again and kill her motivation?
【Aoi】
That won't happen, Aoyagi.
【Madoka】
How are you so sure?
【Aoi】
Irina didn't come here to break Asuka. In fact, that wasn't even her intention during her last visit.
【Aoi】
In her mind, that whole match was just a stepping stone on her path to achieving her goals, and this meeting is no different.
【Madoka】
Huh? But if she's not after Asuka-chan, then...
【Madoka】
Oh! Don't tell me...
【Aoi】
Yeah...
【Masaya】
Well, go on. What do you actually want?
Irina-san takes a step forward after I ask that question.
【Irina】
Answer my question first, Hinata-san.
【Masaya】
Hm?
【Irina】
You don't actually think Asuka Kurashina is the right opponent for Saki, do you?
【Masaya】
What are you trying to say?
Is she implying Asuka's not good enough?
Maybe that was true before, but now she's better than Misaki. By this point, even Shindou-san thinks she has a real shot at winning.
And from what I've seen, I'm with him on that.
【Masaya】
You don't think Asuka can cut it?
【Irina】
No, that's not my point. Asuka-san is a very good player.
【Masaya】
Then what are you...?
【Irina】
When will you stop running away?
Irina-san stabs me right in the heart with a "knife" she has hidden.
@delete
【Masaya】
...What?
【Irina】
When will you finally stop running away, former Flying Circus Junior Japan Representative, Masaya Hinata?
【Madoka】
It's Hinata-kun... isn't it?
【Aoi】
...Yeah.
【Madoka】
What's she planning on doing to him?
【Aoi】
There's only one possibility. She's going to poke open his old wounds.
【Madoka】
His wounds?
【Aoi】
Still, it's something he'll need to face sooner or later, since he's getting more and more involved with FC. Maybe this is a good opportunity.
【Madoka】
I don't know Hinata-kun all that well, so I'm not sure what you're talking about.
【Madoka】
Do you think he'll be okay?
【Aoi】
I don't know, but it should be fine. Masaya has friends by his side now, so he's not alone. Plus, he even has Kurashina.
【Madoka】
Asuka-chan...
【Aoi】
He's a lot stronger now, so things should turn out just fine.
【Madoka】
......
Pain shoots through my body, making it hard to form proper words.
【Masaya】
What are... you...?
【Irina】
I told you that I'd heard of you.
She did mention something along those lines during the summer tournament.
I think it was, "I don't care whether it'll be one of the players you raised, or you yourself..."
But back then, I didn't take her words seriously, since I just assumed she was being dramatic.
【Irina】
That's why I tried to get you to face Saki after the tournament.
【Masaya】
Ah...!
【Irina】
But unfortunately, Ms. Kagami turned down my request.
...I see. That explains what she told me back then.
【Aoi】
"Besides, it's not like I just agreed to everything. I'll have you know that I shot down her first suggestion right away."
【Masaya】
"Oh? What'd she want?"
【Aoi】
"It's not happening, so don't worry about it... Anyway, go prepare for the match now."
【Irina】
You were well known even among the international community, Hinata-san. People praised you to the ends of the Earth, saying you would change FC itself someday, which was why I learned everything I could about you.
【Irina】
And yet... by the time I finally managed to step into the ring, you had quit.
【Masaya】
...What do you want from me?
I barely manage to squeeze out those words with my hoarse voice.
【Irina】
Allow me to repeat myself. When will you stop running away, Masaya Hinata?
【Masaya】
What do you mean? I'm not running away from anything.
【Irina】
You're saying that even though you can't fly? You hide your wings, like a coward.
【Masaya】
Ugh...
【Irina】
What happened to the boy who once aspired to become the best and climb to heights yet unknown?
【Irina】
Pathetic. You're just hiding in fear and making the people you're coaching fight in your place. Tell me, how is that not running away?
【Masaya】
How can you...!
【Irina】
Oh, does the truth hurt?
【Masaya】
L-Like I said, you're wrong!
【Irina】
But I'm not.
【Irina】
You just keep telling these girls they have talent as you place them on the frontline to face strong opponents. Is that <i>really</i> what you want?
【Masaya】
Stop!
【Irina】
The truth is, you're hiding behind your position as a second and coach to keep any sense of shock from a loss at arm's length. Go on, admit it.
【Masaya】
I keep telling you... you're wrong!
【Irina】
Just admit it, Masaya Hinata!
【Irina】
Are you going to keep running away forever? Is this really how you want to live your life?
【Irina】
Answer me!
【Masaya】
Dammit...!
I sink to the ground as my knees give out.
Then, I place my hands on the ground, grip the grass, and crush it.
【Masaya】
No... You're wrong...
I want to say something, anything, but I can't bring myself to say anything substantial.
I thought I'd worked past all this. I thought I'd gotten over most of my trauma already.
But now, my old wounds are throbbing once more. And as I mull over everything, a dark parasite starts to take over my body.
【Masaya】
It's not like...
I keep trying to deny her claims, but my voice is so quiet that I'm sure Irina-san can't make it out anymore.
I know my words won't reach anyone.
Hell, they're not even reaching me...
And so, I hang my head as I begin to feel sick.
But then...
【Asuka】
You're wrong!
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Irina】
Ah...!
I hear a voice deny those claims as they threaten to suffocate me. And, in a way, they give me strength as well.
Startled, I look up.
【Asuka】
You're... wrong!
And when I do, I see Asuka standing there, staring straight into Irina-san's eyes.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san... isn't that kind of person!
【Irina】
Asuka Kurashina... I didn't expect you to join us.
Irina-san's staring at Asuka now, but her expression remains the same.
She's still not fazed by anything we've said. Pretty impressive.
It takes a lot of courage to stand tall and never waver.
【Masaya】
Asuka...?
【Asuka】
I'm sorry I overheard your conversation. It was an accident. I just came to look for you because it seemed like you were taking a lot of time.
【Asuka】
And when I heard what she said, I couldn't hold back.
【Irina】
Oh? Why?
【Asuka】
You just claimed Masaya-san's running away, right? Well, you couldn't be more wrong.
【Irina】
But he <i>is</i> running away. He refuses to fight even though he's more than capable.
【Asuka】
And I'm saying you have the wrong idea.
【Irina】
...Explain.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san <i>is</i> fighting. He's been standing in front of me, fighting to make me a better Skywalker, this whole time.
【Asuka】
He spends every waking moment thinking of new strategies or ways to practice, so he actually has it <i>way</i> harder than me.
【Asuka】
So take it back! Take back what you said about him running away like a coward!
Asuka's words are filled with determination.
However, despite all that, Irina-san remains calm and composed.
【Irina】
Asuka Kurashina.
【Asuka】
Y-Yes?
【Irina】
...I'm sorry that my words have struck a nerve.
【Irina】
However, I will not change my opinion. Hinata-san <i>is</i> running away.
【Asuka】
Why are you...
【Irina】
Because Masaya Hinata is a Skywalker who can reign at the top of the FC world.
For some reason, Irina-san's voice sounds awfully kind all of a sudden.
【Irina】
Come with me, Hinata-san.
She extends a hand out to me after saying that.
【Irina】
The Avalon Group will spare no expense to help raise a player with your potential.
【Irina】
Nationality, gender, none of those matter. We merely desire individuals who are willing to focus solely on being the best.
【Irina】
And I know that's your greatest wish. I know that desire to be the best Skywalker in the world still lingers within you.
【Masaya】
You want me to make a comeback?
【Irina】
That's right. I'm sure you'll help Saki grow, and change the world of FC forever.
Irina-san's smile is dazzling.
【Irina】
Asuka-san still has a lot to learn, so we're willing to assign a professional coach to her. That should set your mind at ease, no?
【Asuka】
I'll get a different coach...?
【Irina】
You don't have time to waste on anything other than practice. Dig yourself out of the pit you're stuck in right this instant, Masaya Hinata.
Right now, my heart's pounding against my chest.
Because of my indecisiveness, she... What the hell am I doing?
【Irina】
This isn't the place you should be. It's time for you to wake up.
【Irina】
Take my hand.
Irina-san extends her hand some more.
And, after a moment of hesitation...
【Irina】
Huh?
I get up and position myself in front of Asuka without taking her hand.
【Masaya】
A place where I can forget everything else and just practice all day, huh?
【Masaya】
Sounds perfect. Bet I would've loved the idea back when I was a kid. Getting to train in a state-of-the-art facility in Europe would've been a dream come true.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san...
Asuka's voice sounds a little hoarse.
【Irina】
I'm glad you understand. That's why you should hurry up and...
【Masaya】
But I'm different now.
【Irina】
......
【Masaya】
I'll never make that choice because I know you're wrong.
【Irina】
I'm wrong...? About what, exactly?
【Masaya】
Asuka.
【Asuka】
Ah...!
【Masaya】
Listen, Asuka isn't some weak, insignificant player like you think.
【Irina】
But she is. You know as well as I do that she doesn't even hold a candle to Saki.
【Masaya】
Maybe not right now, but that could all change tomorrow.
【Irina】
Tomorrow?
【Masaya】
Hell, it could even happen the day after tomorrow, or the day after that. All I know is that she's gonna climb higher and higher. See, what you don't get is that Asuka has no ceiling.
【Irina】
That's a rather foolish statement. Every player realizes their limits eventually. Once someone reaches the top of the world, they start to stagnate.
【Masaya】
And that's my point. I'm saying Asuka's different. She's got her eyes set on something <i>way</i> bigger than being at the top of the FC world, so she'll never waver.
【Irina】
Oh really? Enlighten me, then. Where exactly is she looking?
【Masaya】
The sky.
【Irina】
What...?
【Masaya】
Her main goal is to travel beyond the sky, to keep flying higher and higher. That's Asuka Kurashina's true desire.
【Irina】
Travel beyond... the sky?
I've been wondering what sets Asuka apart for quite a while now.
Why does she never fear strong opponents? How can she keep improving day after day?
I asked myself those questions constantly, and thanks to that, I've finally reached an answer.
【Masaya】
When I first saw Saki Inui, I was afraid of her. But now I know I have nothing to worry about.
【Masaya】
...Asuka and I are going to defeat you two, so I've got no reason to take you up on your offer.
I give Irina-san that reply, bow to her, and then turn away.
【Masaya】
Asuka.
【Asuka】
Yes.
【Masaya】
Let's get going.
We've got more important things to do.
【Asuka】
Okay...!
We turn our backs to Irina-san.
Then, without a moment's delay, we start walking toward the staircase.
【Irina】
Are you really going to abandon FC?
【Irina】
You're a legendary Skywalker who once dominated the sk--
I stop.
And then, I decide to answer her question without ever turning around.
【Masaya】
I will return...
【Masaya】
...with Asuka.
【Irina】
Kgh...!
【Masaya】
Excuse us.
Further than anyone else. Higher than anyone else.
Asuka's trying to reach the place I've always dreamed of seeing.
And she wants to do it with a smile on her face.
【Masaya】
......
【Asuka】
......
We're back at the clubroom, staring off into space silently.
Practice is over for the day, so we're the only ones left.
It feels kinda awkward to be sitting across from each other like this, which is why I'm trying not to meet her gaze.
【Asuka】
U-Um, Masaya-san... I'm sorry.
Asuka breaks the silence.
【Asuka】
I just rushed in and said all those things even though--
【Masaya】
Asuka.
I interrupt Asuka.
【Asuka】
Huh...? Um, yes?
【Masaya】
I'm really happy that you told her I'm fighting alongside you.
【Asuka】
I-It was no big deal...
【Asuka】
I was just trying to convey my honest feelings, since I know for a fact that you've been fighting this whole time.
【Masaya】
Thanks, but...
Back then, Asuka cheered me right up.
I gained strength thanks to her words of encouragement.
However, doubt still lingers in my heart.
【Masaya】
Thing is, she was kinda right... I'm choosing not to fly even though I can.
The sight of me without a pair of FC Grav Shoes on used to be rare.
But now I only ever wear usual commuter ones.
【Masaya】
I wasn't always like this.
Yeah...
I used to wear my flight suit more often than my regular clothes.
But I can't even remember the last time I've worn one.
【Masaya】
I was once a Skywalker.
Those words flow right out of my mouth.
This all happened back when I was still in elementary school.
At the time, I was doing fine in school and more traditional sports, but didn't really stand out in any way.
And that was because I never managed to find anything I could pour my heart into. I just killed time every single day without ever figuring out what I truly wanted to do.
That didn't stop me from looking, though.
I desperately searched for something new I could master, something unique that I could dominate, because I wanted to travel beyond the known world and take in unseen sights.
And that desire grew stronger with each passing day.
Eventually, I discovered FC.
It all started when my dad took me to a regional tournament.
To be honest, I didn't really expect much. I only agreed to tag along because I had nothing better to do.
However, I fell in love with FC instantly.
Players were racing through the sky at unimaginable speeds, employing all sorts of different tactics in a desperate struggle for points.
And most of all, one particular Skywalker left an incredibly strong impression on me.
Aoi Kagami.
Back in the day, no one else in Japan could even touch her.
I was entranced by the sight of a player who swept a regional tournament with little effort.
The sheer beauty of the contrails left behind by her Grav Shoes made a new desire bloom within me.
"I want to fly."
My constant search ended on that day.
The first encounter I had with this revolutionary new form of technology changed my way of life forever.
When I reached the minimum operation age, I got my hands on some Grav Shoes and flew around every chance I got.
There weren't many places I could go, since flight areas were still fairly restricted, but a brand new world opened up to me.
Unfortunately, I couldn't get FC out of my mind.
And soon enough, flying wasn't enough to satisfy me.
I wanted to be faster. I wanted to stoke the fire that had been lit in my heart as I watched the regional tournament.
But most of all, I wanted to meet that player who had inspired me.
Luckily, I got an opportunity to do that rather fast.
My dad knew someone who was related to Aoi-san, so he got her to agree to teach me.
We went over the basics together, and then I worked up the courage to ask her what I truly wanted.
"Please teach me FC."
Aoi-san was dumbfounded by my request, but she quickly burst out laughing.
I still remember what she asked me as she rubbed my head.
"Do you love the sky?"
I don't remember exactly how I replied.
Though, it was probably something like, "Yeah I do" or, "More than anything." Either way, the expression on Aoi-san's face stuck with me.
Despite how cheerful and kind she was acting, there was a sad look in her eyes.
And I didn't understand how that was possible when she was a champion.
【Masaya】
You love flying, don't you?
Asuka nods.
【Masaya】
Thing is, sometimes it's easier to get hurt because of how much you love it.
Should I keep going? Should I actually let Asuka in on how this story ends?
...I should. Considering where Asuka's headed, I'm sure she'll experience the exact same sense of pain someday.
【Masaya】
...Do you want me to continue?
【Asuka】
......
【Asuka】
...Please do.
Asuka gives me an even firmer nod this time around.
She's staring at me intently, indicating that she doesn't want to miss a single word.
And so, I slowly continue my story.
Aoi-san agreed to become my coach, so I was on cloud nine.
She spent half a year drilling the basics into me, at which point I participated in a tournament full of older, more experienced players. But somehow, I managed to finish in third.
After that, the FC Association recognized me as a representative of Japan in the newly established U-12 bracket.
Thanks to that, the number of interviews requests kept going up. And, around the same time, Aoi-san participated in the World Championship, so people started to talk me up as her disciple.
They started to claim I was some prodigy who would change FC forever.
All that talk made me certain FC was what I was looking for all along, which was why I spread my wings and soared through the sky to my heart's content.
The sight of me flying seemed to make a lot of people happy.
Which, in turn, had me over the moon.
However...
【Masaya】
Haaah... Haaah... What... is this...?
My whole body was covered in sweat and my breathing was ragged.
That was the third time I had woken up due to a nightmare that day.
My dried up throat hurt and my vision was fuzzy.
Sleepless nights have become the norm for me.
I won the regionals in my age group, then proceeded to dominate the nationals.
Aoi-san was so happy that people would've thought she was the one who won.
Around then, the people around me started talking about going international.
However, the more I kept winning, the more I started to fear flying.
My Grav Shoes, which used to feel like an extension of my body, became heavy weights that dragged me down.
The pressure was overwhelming me.
I couldn't tell Aoi-san that, though.
She believed in me more than anyone else, to the point where it seemed like watching me improve was her main source of joy in life.
I knew she would do her best to help fix my problem if I told her.
But I could also picture the disappointed look on her face, which kept me from telling her anything.
Besides, at that time, Aoi-san was busy practicing for her international debut.
She was already sacrificing enough of her valuable time for me, so I figured it wasn't right to stress her out more by burdening her with my personal problems.
Aoi Kagami was the player I looked up to most.
That was why I decided to handle it on my own.
...Unfortunately, the pressure I was exposed to was beyond what my little body could take.
【Masaya】
Ugh... I feel sick... Urk...!
The nightmares and sleepless nights grew worse, transforming into a sense of nausea that constantly tormented me.
【Masaya】
Why... is this happening...?
After being awakened by my usual nightmares, my gaze fell onto the shelf with all my trophies, ribbons, and interview clippings on it.
【Masaya】
This isn't what I wanted...
Why did I have to suffer?
Flying through the sky used to be the most fun thing in the world.
Flying higher and faster than anyone else used to be pure bliss.
But I could only ever get to that point by competing in tournaments and coming out on top.
I wanted the fun to last forever, so I had to keep practicing and winning.
But the more I won, the more the pressure built up.
At that point, I tried to use the "glory" that supposedly came with winning to distract myself from the pressure.
...But I knew all along that it had grown to a point where I could no longer ignore it.
【Masaya】
I just wanted to fly...
【Masaya】
I just wanted to have fun flying...
I was talking to my own, sweat-drenched hand.
Naturally, I didn't receive any response.
Then, on a certain day one week before the world championships...
...I played against a random boy I met by chance while I was practicing.
I never imagined I would lose. I mean, there was no way someone who dominated the nationals could lose to an amateur, right?
And yet... the boy grew at an astonishing rate over a short two hour period.
Techniques I mastered through weeks of harsh practice, ways of flying I trained by working to the point where I had tears in my eyes...
He kept learning them like they were no sweat.
【? ? ?】
Amazing. You can fly like this, huh? Man, this is real fun!
There's nothing fun about this.
Cut it out and give back what you stole!
【? ? ?】
Hey! You hear me? Show me more awesome ways to fly!
No! How much more are you gonna steal from me before you're satisfied?!
How are you learning all these things I worked hard to master so easily?!
Give them back! Give everything back!
【? ? ?】
What's wrong? What about our match?
Shut up! I'm done here!
I mean, if we keep playing... I...
Stop it...! Quit asking for more!
【? ? ?】
Why can't we keep going?
Shut up! Go away! Don't ever show your face around me again!
Don't ask me why!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
【Masaya】
Haaah... Haaah... Haaah...!
Torn magazines and tournament certificates were before my eyes.
The trophy I won had been broken into two pieces at the neck.
【Masaya】
What the hell... What the hell!
I grabbed the scattered scraps of paper and threw them to the ground.
The word "prodigy," which was on one of the articles about me, entered my eyes.
However, it was fuzzy because my vision was stained with tears.
【Masaya】
Haha...! Hahaha...!
I stared at that scrap as I laughed at myself.
【Masaya】
A prodigy...? How exactly am I a prodigy?
Everything was taken from me.
I strongly believed I found my place in life.
I strongly believed I could stay there, looking up at the sky forever.
I strongly believed I was ahead of anyone else.
And yet, everything came crashing down around me.
【Masaya】
Someone like him is the real deal...
Someone like him, who managed to master everything I threw at him, was the prodigy.
He was the one who deserved to remain in the sky.
【Masaya】
Hic... Hic... G-Goddammit!
At that point, I just wanted to forget it all.
The sky, the world... and also FC.
I could no longer follow in Aoi-san's footsteps.
In fact, I didn't even have a right to remain in the sky...
【Masaya】
And that's why I ran away.
I explained absolutely everything to her.
From the reason I quit FC, to what was going through my head.
And honestly, it kinda feels like it's helping me come to terms with the past.
@delete
【Masaya】
Pretty pathetic, huh?
【Masaya】
Here I am talking big, trying to give everyone pep talks, when I'm just a coward who doesn't dare to take to the sky.
【Masaya】
I'm a terrible coach.
I managed to stand my ground and fire back at Irina-san earlier, but...
That only happened because I didn't want to let Asuka down. It isn't like I felt particularly strong or confident in that moment.
I just barely pulled myself together thanks to Asuka.
【Asuka】
That's...
Asuka seems to be having trouble finding the right words.
【Asuka】
That's not true at all!
【Asuka】
That story just convinces me that you <i>are</i> the best coach!
【Masaya】
I'm not.
【Asuka】
You are!
Asuka immediately denies my words, which makes it hard for me to respond.
【Asuka】
Your painful memories are helping you teach a good for nothing girl like me.
【Masaya】
But I ran away...
【Asuka】
And because you did, you can teach me how to avoid the same outcome.
【Asuka】
That isn't something just anyone can do.
【Masaya】
......
【Asuka】
Please don't put yourself down anymore.
【Asuka】
In my eyes, you're the cool, kind, generous person who taught me the joys of flight.
【Masaya】
I am...?
She really feels that way about me?
I remember saying something just like that to Aoi-san...
Yeah, I'm sure that happened, which is why I know how to react.
No one wants to see their idols fall, and Aoi-san never let me down in that regard.
If I deny Asuka's words now, I'll kill her motivation.
【Masaya】
Asuka...
【Asuka】
Y-Yes!
【Masaya】
...Sorry. I won't whine anymore.
【Masaya】
If you think I'm cool, I'll just have to work real hard to live up to that.
【Asuka】
U-Um... I didn't offend you or anything, did I?
【Masaya】
No... not at all.
I pat Asuka's head lightly.
【Masaya】
Thanks, you cheered me up. I mean it.
【Asuka】
Ah...!
【Asuka】
You're welcome...!
I can't get all depressed when Asuka's around.
It's fine when I'm alone, but when I'm with her, I have to live up to the image she has of me in her mind.
【Masaya】
Well, it's time to head home.
The sky's starting to turn orange. Better get home before it's dark out.
【Masaya】
Asuka, you should...
I look at Asuka.
For some reason, she is gazing at me with sparkling eyes.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san... May I make a selfish request?
【Masaya】
Go on.
【Asuka】
I want to see it. I want to see you fly!
【Asuka】
Please show me what kind of player you used to be!
【Masaya】
......
I look out the window.
In the distance, I can make out the line-shaped contrails left behind by an airplane.
Back in the day, my only desire was to explore that vast blue world.
【Masaya】
Turn to the sky, and don't avert your eyes. The answer lies there...
I repeat that mantra to myself.
My fingers are noticeably stiff. Seems I've been clenching them this whole time.
【Asuka】
I know we only have practice shoes for you, so that may be hard...
【Masaya】
Nah, it's fine.
There are some Grav Shoes in our equipment box.
They seemed usable, so I put them on.
【Masaya】
...How many years has it been now?
This feels so wrong...
They don't feel anything like the Grav Shoes I use to commute to school.
【Asuka】
Um, we can always do this another day if--
【Masaya】
No.
I turn Asuka's offer down and shoot her a smile.
【Masaya】
They'll do.
And then...
I look toward the slowly setting sun...
...and truly fly again for the first time in many years.
【Asuka】
Wow... Amazing!
I can faintly make out Asuka's surprised voice.
At first, I only move in a straight line. I pretend I'm on the first line and fly down it in a form that reduces drag to a minimum.
【Asuka】
He's so fast...!
To my surprise, it seems I haven't forgotten much.
【Masaya】
(Good.)
I haven't used FC Grav Shoes in years, but that doesn't seem to be hurting me at all.
I fact, I feel the same sensation I did back when I was so into FC that I was sleeping with my Grav Shoes in my arms...
I'm a little moved, honestly.
【Masaya】
Okay, I'll show you something a little more match-oriented!
I do a U-turn and fly toward Asuka.
【Asuka】
Huh, what...?
Asuka appears bewildered.
【Masaya】
Stay where you are! Though, if you get the chance to touch me, go for it!
【Asuka】
Wh-What, really?
【Masaya】
Yeah, if you can...
I pick up speed.
【Masaya】
Watch closely, Asuka!
【Asuka】
O-Okay!
【Masaya】
This is how you deal with an opponent who's waiting for you in front of second.
I increase my speed and keep rushing toward her.
【Masaya】
Usually you stop here for a moment, right?
【Asuka】
Y-Yes, that's right!
【Masaya】
Well, you can actually get past your opponent like this!
I rush right into Asuka, then slightly alter my trajectory moments before impact.
【Asuka】
Whoa...!
I fly a tight circle to dodge around her with minimal movement, and blow past her without slowing down.
It's an advanced move that takes a whole lot of practice.
【Masaya】
Pretty cool, huh?!
【Asuka】
Yes! I've never seen anyone do that before!
【Masaya】
Okay, next, let's have a dogfight...
I do another U-turn and stop in front of Asuka.
【Masaya】
There are several ways to break out of the Bird Cage in this situation...
【Asuka】
The flurry of attacks we're practicing right is one, right?!
【Masaya】
Right. But there's something else that'd work even better.
【Asuka】
What is it?
【Masaya】
You'll see.
I fly toward Asuka's left as fast as I can.
【Asuka】
I'm not letting you escape!
Asuka responds by tilting right and going for my back.
And right as her hand closes in on me...
【Masaya】
Got you!
I used the repulsive force from Asuka to leap backward.
【Asuka】
Oh, this is...
It's basically the same as Asuka's special move. I used a backflip to switch positions with her.
【Asuka】
But I can deal with that!
Asuka instantly spins around and tries to get behind me again.
【Masaya】
Nice reaction. But...
I cancel the loop midway, twist my body 45 degrees, and fly ahead.
【Asuka】
No way...!
Unable to cope with that, Asuka exposes her back to me.
And I take that chance to score a point.
【Asuka】
Haaah... Haaah... How did you even do that?
Asuka starts asking for tips right away.
I'm not surprised. It takes a lot of work to seamlessly chain one motion into another.
【Masaya】
I took me a long time to learn. It's real fun to do once you master it, though.
【Asuka】
I bet!
【Masaya】
I'll teach you once you've gotten better.
【Asuka】
It's a promise!
The two of us get swept up in the moment and soar through the sky for quite a while.
We completely ignore the announcement that the sun is setting.
And instead of heading back, we just fly through the cold air as if it's the most fun thing in the world.
【Masaya】
Wow, I didn't know it was so late.
We're exhausted now.
Somehow, we didn't even notice the sun setting before this point.
【Asuka】
Oh, what? But I want to fly more...
【Masaya】
Same...
We exchange a smile.
I can't believe flying around without a care in the world was so fun...
I feel like an idiot for avoiding it all these years.
【Asuka】
Thank you, Masaya-san...
【Masaya】
Huh? What for?
【Asuka】
Well, you flew for me, didn't you?
【Asuka】
...You were probably <i>really</i> scared, but you did it anyway.
【Asuka】
I really am hopeless... I can't help but rely on your kindness.
【Masaya】
You haven't done anything wrong.
【Asuka】
R-Really?
【Masaya】
Yeah. Honestly, I'm the one who's been relying on you.
【Masaya】
So don't thank me. In fact, let me thank you.
【Asuka】
Huh? Why?
There's so much I'm grateful for that I don't know where to begin.
Slowly but surely, she's been leading me to this point, bringing me closer to this place I've been scared of for so long.
【Masaya】
You're the whole reason I'm involved with FC again. I don't know what I'd be doing right now if you didn't ask for my help.
【Asuka】
Are you talking about when I asked you to be my coach?
【Masaya】
Yeah. I didn't expect you to get so worked up about it.
【Asuka】
I-I'm sorry. I was just <i>really</i> desperate...
【Masaya】
...Right. And that pure, passionate part of you is what inspired a change in me.
【Asuka】
Huh?
She made me remember the joy I felt when I first asked Aoi-san to take me under her wing.
And now, there's no way I can ever forget it again.
Thanks to her, my love for FC has started to return.
My desire to soar through the air, to travel beyond the sky, has returned to me.
【Masaya】
If you didn't push me, I would've ignored FC for the rest of my life.
It almost feels like Asuka knew about my inner turmoil on some level.
Maybe she even asked me to fly in order to help me...
【Masaya】
Thank you... Asuka.
【Asuka】
......
【Masaya】
I'm glad I got to fly alongside you.
I can't even begin to explain how much she's done for me.
Earlier, she stood up to Irina-san to protect me.
And now, she's accepting all of my flaws and encouraging me.
I can't possibly thank her enough for everything.
【Masaya】
Anyway, we need to get home. It's back to practice tomorrow.
I turn in the direction of my place and get ready to take off.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san.
But then, Asuka calls my name, stopping me in my tracks.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san.
She calls out to me yet again.
Her voice sounds really soft... Have I ever heard this tone before?
【Masaya】
Asuka...
My voice comes out a little hoarse.
...Oh.
I get it.
I understand how I managed to finally overcome my trauma.
I couldn't do it alone, and time didn't heal it.
I only managed to conquer it because I have Asuka by my side.
Thanks to her, my fear of flying has disappeared.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san...
Until now, I've been pushing these feelings aside.
But Asuka's voice is making it hard for me to keep my emotions in check.
Warm, fuzzy feelings that comfort me and make my heart race...
Powerful, kind words that force me to face upward even when I'm on the edge of despair...
All those things well up in me at the same time.
【Masaya】
Asuka, I...
Asuka's engulfed in the warm light of the setting sun.
Right now, I want to shout my feelings from the rooftops.
I know I have to tell her, but...
【Asuka】
Masaya-san...
What's the count at?
Asuka called out my name yet again.
【Asuka】
Just saying your name is more than enough to make me happy.
【Asuka】
I've been wondering why for a while now, including when we were flying around earlier.
【Asuka】
And then, when you said thank you, my whole body started to feel all warm and tingly. That's when I realized...
【Asuka】
Masaya-san...
【Asuka】
I love you.
【Masaya】
Ah...
...Holy shit!
I should've stepped up and taken the lead... Man, I'm a <i>total</i> dumbass.
【Masaya】
I'm sorry, Asuka.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san...?
【Masaya】
I'm hopeless.
【Masaya】
I mean, I love you so much, but I made you confess first.
【Asuka】
Ah...! Hehe...
【Masaya】
Haha...
We look at each other and laugh.
【Masaya】
Asuka.
【Asuka】
Yes.
I gaze into Asuka's eyes.
We see each other almost every day, but for some reason, it kind of feels like we're just meeting for the very first time.
【Masaya】
I love you too.
【Asuka】
......
【Asuka】
...Thank you. I'm so happy!
Her smile's as bright as the setting sun behind her.
【Asuka】
Hic... I'm... really... happy...
【Masaya】
Huh? Asuka...?
Shining droplets start to spill down from Asuka's eyes.
【Asuka】
Um, I'm sorry! I, I...!
【Asuka】
Hic... When I looked at you, my feelings just exploded, so I ended up confessing.
【Asuka】
I never expected you to say it back, so I'm <i>really</i> happy...
【Asuka】
So happy that... hic... I can't hold back my tears...
【Masaya】
......
How can I ever repay her for her kindness?
This girl puts on a cheerful front, but beneath that is a shy, meek side that she hides to keep from burdening people.
I'm happy to hear she loves me, but I also understand that I have to shoulder a heavy responsibility.
【Masaya】
Asuka.
【Asuka】
Yes...?
【Masaya】
I love you, Asuka.
【Asuka】
Ah...
【Asuka】
I love you too, Masaya-san!
There are still some tears in her eyes.
However, I simply pretend not to notice and smile.
And Asuka smiles right back at me.
Eventually, the sun sets and it's dark out.
But that doesn't matter, since we want to be together for as long as possible.
【Aoi】
Didn't expect you to call me out here.
【Masaya】
I know, right? How many years has it been?
【Aoi】
I forget. It's been <i>way</i> too long.
【Masaya】
True...
【Masaya】
I practiced with Asuka today.
【Aoi】
...I see.
【Masaya】
When I finally put on FC shoes again, I realized that I haven't forgotten a single one of the moves you taught me.
【Aoi】
That's good...
【Masaya】
...It was fun.
【Aoi】
...I see. Fun, huh?
【Masaya】
Mhm...
【Aoi】
...We used to practice here all the time.
【Masaya】
I think you faced me here right before I went off to the nationals, right?
【Aoi】
Yeah. You did so bad that you ran back home.
【Masaya】
Look, I know it's all in the past now, but that was terrible! I actually considered calling it quits!
【Aoi】
Hahaha. Sorry about that...
【Aoi】
......
【Aoi】
Is that the reason you called me out here?
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Aoi】
"I won't ever play FC again, so don't bring it up around me. I don't want to remember anything about it..."
【Aoi】
This is also the place where you gave me that speech, right?
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Aoi】
Do you remember how I replied?
【Masaya】
Of course. You said, "I'll keep waiting here for you."
【Aoi】
I told you I'd welcome you back with open arms.
【Masaya】
Yeah... You did...
【Aoi】
I couldn't stop worrying about you after you quit FC...
【Aoi】
I'm so glad, Masaya. I really am.
【Masaya】
I'm... sorry...
【Aoi】
Don't apologize. I'm <i>really</i> happy. I finally get to say the words I've been holding onto this whole time...
【Aoi】
......
【Aoi】
...Welcome back, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Thanks... I'm back, Aoi-san!
【★】
Asuka Route -- End
