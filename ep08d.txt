August has already come and gone, but it still feels like summer in Kyushu.
Today's a real scorcher, and it just so happens to be the first day of our school as well.
It's September, so it's time for the second semester to start at Kunahama.
【Asuka】
Masaya-san!
We're finally done with classes.
And as soon as we are, Asuka practically flings herself toward my seat.
【Asuka】
I can start practice again today! I can start practice again today!
【Masaya】
There's no need to repeat yourself, Asuka.
【Asuka】
I'm just so happy that I don't have to hold back anymore! I <i>finally</i> get to fly again!
【Asuka】
Let's start practice right away!
【Masaya】
Sure... But before that, Asuka...
【Asuka】
Yes?
【Masaya】
You know that Rika's practicing with us now, right?
【Asuka】
Yes, of course I know that. Why?
【Masaya】
If you notice anything at all, just let me know, no matter what it is.
【Masaya】
Show me through actions if you need to. I give you permission for anything.
【Asuka】
U-Uh, okay...?
Asuka doesn't seem to understand, but I move on anyway.
【Masaya】
Well, let's get to practice. C'mon!
【Asuka】
R-Right...
【Asuka】
And so...
Asuka takes a deep, emotional breath.
【Asuka】
I'm coming back to practice, starting today!
【Everyone】
Yaaay!
【Misaki】
Yaaay!
【Mashiro】
Yaaay!
【Madoka】
Yaaay!
【Rika】
Yaaay!
【Asuka】
This is going to be great!
【Misaki】
I'm surprised you actually listened to Masaya and didn't show up once.
【Mashiro】
Knowing you, it must have been really hard staying away.
【Asuka】
Oh, it was. But I knew seeing you all practice would make me want to join, which would make my injury worse. Luckily...
【Madoka】
Hm?
【Asuka】
Coach gave me a ton of DVDs. I used a stool to do some stairstepping and work out my legs as I watched them.
【Misaki】
DVDs... from Masaya... Hold up...
【Mashiro】
The contents of them must be far too abnormal for us to even imagine...
【Rika】
A-Abnormal...?
【Asuka】
Th-They weren't!
【Masaya】
Why do you always go out of your way to make me look like a perv?
【Misaki】
Well, I mean, you are, Masaya. I'm just speaking the truth.
【Masaya】
Oh, <i>come on</i> you're making me sound like a total scumbag! The only things on those disks were FC matches!
【Asuka】
I watched them all to train my mind. It kind of felt like I was practicing inside my head, so staying at home didn't feel all that bad.
【Rika】
You were practicing... inside your head?
【Asuka】
Yes! It was so satisfying!
【Rika】
Asuka-san, you're... sort of incredible.
【Asuka】
Huh? How so?
【Misaki】
Hahaha, she's right. You're insane, Asuka.
Misaki claps Rika on the back while laughing.
【Masaya】
Asuka, you had a wrist injury, so I'm going to keep you away from any actual matches for now.
【Asuka】
Okay.
I'm probably going too easy on her, but better safe than sorry.
【Masaya】
We'll start with field flying, same as always.
【Everyone】
Okay!
【Rika】
Okay!
【Asuka】
Okay!
【Misaki】
Okay!
【Mashiro】
Okay!
【Asuka】
......
Asuka stands beside me, staring up at everyone else while they practice.
【Masaya】
How does being back at practice feel?
【Asuka】
It's amazing! I focused on the basic strength training you taught me while I was away, so I feel like my form's more stable than ever!
【Masaya】
I see. Maybe this was a blessing in disguise, then.
【Madoka】
There's a silver lining to everything, huh?
【Asuka】
I guess so.
Asuka mutters as she looks back toward the field.
【Asuka】
Ngh...
Hm?
【Asuka】
Ngh...
Asuka's fidgeting.
【Masaya】
You okay?
【Asuka】
U-Um, well... that move Rika-chan and Mashiro-chan are practicing...
【Masaya】
Hm? Oh, that one.
Rika charges in at Mashiro headfirst, pushing her toward the water.
It's the Suicida.
I've been having them study the technique as part of our anti-Kurobuchi plan.
【Asuka】
Um... Uh... Um...
Asuka's still fidgeting.
【Madoka】
What's up? Need to use the bathroom?
【Asuka】
No, um, that's not it...
Asuka fixes her gaze on me.
【Asuka】
We're practicing that for if we have to face people who play dirty, right?
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Asuka】
So you're assuming we'll have to face Kurobuchi-san, then?
【Masaya】
Yeah.
Asuka only beat Kurobuchi because she was disqualified, and Rika's never even played her.
So no one's <i>actually</i> lost to her, but...
【Masaya】
If you lost to a Speeder, you'd wanna practice taking on Speeders, right? Not only does working on your weaknesses make you physically stronger, but it also makes you mentally stronger.
Going into a match thinking, "I've conquered my weaknesses" rather than just, "I <i>have</i> weaknesses" can lead to a completely different outcome.
【Masaya】
For better or worse, Rika can't move forward unless she defeats Kurobuchi.
Personally, I'm fine with just ignoring her.
But this is a hurdle Rika wants to transcend.
【Asuka】
Is that so?
【Masaya】
Yeah. I know it sounds a bit melodramatic, but it's the plain truth.
【Asuka】
Oh no, I think you're right. U-Um...!
Asuka suddenly raises her voice.
【Masaya】
Wh-What's up?
Asuka sort of curls up, drawing in a deep breath...
【Asuka】
I'm going to the calligraphy club!
【Masaya】
The calligraphy club?! Wh-Why?!
【Asuka】
See you later! FLY!
【Masaya】
H-Hey!
Asuka flies away before I can stop her.
【Masaya】
I feel like I've inspired her somehow, but...
Why is she going to the calligraphy club? I don't get it.
【Asuka】
I'm back!
【Masaya】
Hey. Gonna tell me why you flew off now?
She's also changed out of her practice gear into her flight suit.
【Asuka】
I have a friend at that club, and they let me borrow their calligraphy paper, pen, and ink.
【Masaya】
Uh, cool, but what does calligraphy have to do with anything?
I've never had the urge to indulge in that hobby.
【Asuka】
I'm going to use them to make a declaration of intent!
【Masaya】
A what now?
Asuka spins around on the spot.
【Asuka】
Rika-chan!
She yells up toward the field.
【Rika】
Huh...?
Rika stops practicing and descends toward Asuka.
【Rika】
What's wrong?
Asuka stomps her feet on the ground, drawing herself up to full height as she thrusts a letter out toward Rika.
【Rika】
...Huh?
Rika freezes in confusion.
【Mashiro】
What's going on?
【Misaki】
Weeell, what's all this?
Everyone's crowded around Asuka.
【Masaya】
What'd you write?
I walk around Asuka to get a look at the front of the paper.
【Masaya】
...Huh?
The calligraphy is pretty bad, but...
【Asuka】
It's a letter of challenge!
I see...
I never would've guessed this was why she flew off.
【Rika】
...What does that mean?
Rika tilts her head, clearly confused.
【Misaki】
She's challenging you to a duel. It's time for a showdown!
【Rika】
...Huh? Hm? Huh? You mean... Whaaat?! I have to fight Asuka-san?
【Misaki】
Mashiro...
【Mashiro】
I'm putting 500 yen on Asuka-senpai.
【Madoka】
'Kay, I'm putting 300 on Rika-chan.
【Masaya】
Hey, don't start betting on them.
【Asuka】
It's not trying to start a fight! I just want to have a FC match with you, Rika-chan!
【Rika】
Y-You do?
Rika glances over at me.
【Masaya】
Well, why not?
【Rika】
Wh-Whaaaaaat?!
【Rika】
A-Are you sure about this, Masaya-san?
【Masaya】
You've finished warming up, so there's nothing stopping you.
【Rika】
W-Well... I suppose you're right...
【Masaya】
Asuka seems to have made a full recovery. Plus, I thought you wanted to face her?
【Rika】
Yes... I'm not entirely sure what's going on, but I'll happily take Asuka-san on.
【Asuka】
Don't be happy! This is a challenge! A duel! A fight!
Hm?
【Asuka】
Well it's not a fight, but it is a fight!
I finally make out the look in Asuka's eyes.
Oh, I get it now.
【Masaya】
Okay, once Rika's changed into her flight suit, we'll start the match.
【Madoka】
Hm, you sure you should be letting Asuka-chan play a match on her first day back?
【Masaya】
I tested her a bunch and she seems to be back to full strength. It should be fine.
【Misaki】
You're saying if someone begs and screams, you'll let them do whatever they want, huh?
【Mashiro】
That's some useful information.
【Masaya】
I wouldn't let them do anything, but I <i>definitely</i> won't stop them from practicing more.
【Misaki】
Ugh, boring!
【Mashiro】
Right?
【Masaya】
Okay, let's start the match. I'll be the second for both of you, but I won't give any actual instructions. Rika, Asuka, head over to first.
【Asuka】
Okay. FLY!
【Rika】
Take off!
The two of them say their activation keys, then fly away.
【Masaya】
Misaki, can you be the referee?
【Misaki】
Sure.
【Masaya】
Hold on, Misaki.
I call her over.
【Misaki】
Sup?
I lower my voice.
【Masaya】
Go easy on any rule violations.
【Misaki】
Hm, you sure? Shouldn't I be stricter than usual, since this is Asuka's first day back and all?
【Masaya】
No, don't worry about that. Rika won't do anything too rough.
【Misaki】
Well, okay... Ah, hm...
Misaki stares over at the two girls hovering near first.
【Misaki】
May as well let Asuka do what she wants...
【Masaya】
Exactly. I'm counting on you.
【Misaki】
'Kay. Ready furr liftoff...
Misaki says her activation key.
If I'm right about what Asuka intends to do, then she's trying to help Rika.
Though, I've gotta say, it'll be a pretty rough lesson.
【Masaya】
(Why's everyone here so damn stubborn.)
I smile wryly.
【Misaki】
So, like, I'm gonna be the ref.
【Asuka/Rika】
Thank you.
【Asuka】
Thank you.
【Rika】
Thank you.
Asuka turns toward Rika with a confused expression on her face.
【Asuka】
Rika-chan, why are you practicing here instead of Takafuji?
【Rika】
Well... I wanted to broaden my horizons by taking in new sights here at Kunahama.
【Asuka】
Wow, how diligent!
【Rika】
I thought I would get stuck in a rut if I only practiced at Takafuji, so I took this chance to join all of you.
【Asuka】
Are you sure that isn't just an excuse?
【Rika】
Huh? What other reason could I have?
【Asuka】
I'm just wondering if you actually came here for FC at all.
【Rika】
Huh...? Why else would I be here?
【Asuka】
For Masaya-san, maybe?
【Rika】
Huh...?!
【Asuka】
I was just thinking, maybe you're only here because you want to spend more time with Masaya-san... Am I wrong?
【Rika】
Y-You are! I came here to practice, I swear!
【Asuka】
You mean you're using practice as an excuse to see Masaya-san, right?
【Rika】
Th-That's not what I said at all!
【Misaki】
That's enough, Rika-chan. We don't wanna delay this match too long, yeah?
【Rika】
Asuka-san is the one who's acting strange.
【Asuka】
Huh? Really?
【Rika】
Why are you playing dumb?!
【Misaki】
Who cares. Just stop talking already.
【Rika】
Okay.
【Asuka】
Understood! Let's stop our chat here, Rika-chan.
【Rika】
...Asuka-san.
【Misaki】
Aight, let's start. Ready, set...
【Rika】
......
【Asuka】
......
【Misaki】
Go!
The two of them start at the exact same time.
Asuka's an All-Rounder, while Rika's a Speeder.
Normally, Rika would score the first buoy touch, while Asuka would jump to the second line to wait.
【Asuka】
La la la...
However, Asuka glides forward along the line instead.
And she's humming to herself happily as she does.
【Rika】
Ah...!
An All-Rounder's initial velocity gives them the advantage on the first line, but they'll be left in the dust by line two or three.
【Asuka】
...Here she comes.
Rika is gradually approaching Asuka, who's ahead of her.
Once she's about level with Asuka's shoulder, Asuka turns to face her.
【Asuka】
You're so fast, Rika-chan.
Rika seems kind of angry as she turns to face Asuka.
【Rika】
I <i>am</i> a Speeder... Huh?
Asuka stretches out an arm to block Rika.
【Asuka】
Got you!
And she manages to touch Rika's shoulder.
【Rika】
Eek!
The two of them are pushed away from each other by the recoil, but having initiated the touch, Asuka regains her form first.
And despite her momentarily ruined form, the recoil has pushed her further ahead, so she hasn't lost any speed.
On the other hand, Rika got sent backward, which means she's slowed down considerably.
Rika turns towards Misaki, who's refereeing.
【Rika】
Foul play! She cheated!
【Misaki】
Huh? What?
【Rika】
She just cheated!
Contact on the first line is forbidden. That's the most basic rule of FC.
【Rika】
Asuka-san touched me.
【Misaki】
She did?
【Rika】
<i>Of course</i> she did!
【Misaki】
Well, I didn't see anything, and I doubt she did it on purpose, so I'm just gonna let things continue.
【Rika】
What...?
I've been watching in silence, but I choose to finally speak up.
【Masaya】
Rika, there will be times when the referee won't stop play because of a rule violation. You need to focus on the match when that happens. There's no point complaining.
【Rika】
...Understood.
Asuka comes to a halt in front of second and turns around.
【Asuka】
Um, Rika-chan!
【Rika】
What is it?
【Asuka】
Do you mind if I touch this buoy? Or should I let you do it?
【Rika】
Ngh! Please, go ahead.
【Asuka】
I'll move over to the second line, then.
Asuka uses the recoil from touching second to start heading down the second line.
【Rika】
......
Rika jumps over to it as well and starts chasing Asuka down.
【Asuka】
Oh, you're right on my tail, huh? Well, I doubt I can beat a Speeder in a race, so...
Asuka starts up a Scissors to get into a position to touch Rika's back.
【Rika】
......
Rika slows down in an attempt to be more careful.
Normally, when your opponent tries to use Scissors or a similar maneuver, you fly as fast as possible to shake them off.
That's also what Speeders excel at, but the incident on the first line has Rika playing scared.
【Asuka】
Let's have a dogfight, Rika-chan.
【Rika】
No!
【Asuka】
You've left me no other choice, then.
Asuka stretches out both arms like a stag beetle's pincers, tempting Rika toward her.
【Rika】
Ah...!
Rika slows to a crawl.
All Asuka's doing is threatening to use the pincers on her. I've already taught Rika how to deal with it, so this should be no sweat.
Things have been going great during practice, but her diligent personality still shows itself at times like this...
【Asuka】
Here I come!
Asuka does a rotation in the air through a sharp-angled High Yo-Yo, aiming to get behind Rika's back.
【Rika】
Ah...!
Rika's lost her composure. She's lured forward by Asuka's movements, which exposes her back.
【Rika】
Aaah!
Rika uses the force from being touched to dive into a Low Yo-Yo and head toward third.
【Asuka】
Ah...!
Asuka, matching Rika's timing, also heads toward the buoy.
Asuka's movements are so smooth that it's hard to imagine she hasn't practiced in such a long time.
【Masaya】
Rika! Asuka's chasing your back! If you go straight for third, you'll be in trouble!
【Rika】
Ngh!
I know what's on Rika's mind right now.
The memories of Asuka's match with Kurobuchi, and how Asuka got concussed.
The sight of Kurobuchi chasing after Asuka from behind, arms and legs spread out to pincer her.
【Rika】
Ah!
Rika leans forward and flies toward the underside of the buoy.
Seeing this...
【Asuka】
I'll just take the buoy then.
...Asuka says that and slowly touches the buoy, using it to soar down the third line.
【Rika】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah...
Rika's shoulders heave.
【Rika】
I understand.
【Masaya】
Understand what?
【Rika】
Asuka-san's acting like Kurobuchi-san to help me... right?
【Masaya】
In a way, yeah, but I bet it's a little different from what you think.
【Rika】
What do you mean?
【Masaya】
Asuka isn't just copying Kurobuchi, she's becoming her.
【Rika】
She's not copying her... but </i>is</i> her...?
【Masaya】
Kurobuchi tries to provoke her opponent with words to make them uneasy, to plant fear in them to gain the upper hand. She does it all to win, and that's what Asuka's doing now.
【Rika】
......
【Masaya】
She's come to understand Kurobuchi's inner workings, so she's not just copying her on a surface level. You've been preparing to face rough opponents, right?
【Rika】
...Yes.
【Masaya】
There was nothing wrong with how you were practicing, but now that you're afraid, you can't put what you've learned to use, can you?
【Rika】
...I can't.
Rika's reply is tinged with frustration.
【Masaya】
Listen, this is what Kurobuchi's style is all about. You've prepared yourself for it, but you still get caught up in it.
【Rika】
...What am I supposed to do?
【Masaya】
The answer to that question is the playstyle you wish to have, Rika. And it's the playstyle I want to teach you.
【Rika】
Huh?
Rika looks over at Asuka, then looks back to me.
【Masaya】
To have fun while you're flying. To enjoy FC.
【Rika】
E-Even in situations like this?
【Masaya】
Of course.
【Rika】
But my opponent's a cheater! How am I--
【Masaya】
That's what makes it fun.
【Rika】
Huh?
【Masaya】
There are people out there who are so desperate to score a win that they'll resort to cheating. Don't you think it's fun facing people with such strong desires?
【Rika】
...I don't understand.
【Masaya】
Playing against opponents who are passionate about something is fun.
【Rika】
I think I get that, but...
【Masaya】
They use fear and panic to try and win, but if you understand that and can still face them, it's fun. Playing FC is always fun, no matter your opponent.
【Rika】
Masaya-san... You're incredible. Do you really feel that way?
【Masaya】
...I don't.
【Rika】
Huh?
【Masaya】
If I did, I never would have quit FC... But you kept playing even after meeting someone like Kurobuchi. That means you have what it takes.
【Rika】
I do...?
【Masaya】
Having fun is about being proactive while you play, taking in the fear and unrest and still moving forward. You can do that, Rika.
【Rika】
How can you be so sure?
【Masaya】
Because I've watched you, Rika. I've seen how much you love FC. Doing something you love is always fun, right?
【Rika】
Y-Yes.
【Masaya】
I get that you hate foul play, but that's part of FC. The more things you love, the more things you enjoy.
【Rika】
...Right.
【Masaya】
I think you can learn to love all aspects of FC, Rika.
【Rika】
Right!
She gives me a firm nod.
【Asuka】
Um...
At this point, Asuka slides into our conversation.
【Asuka】
Uh, listen... you set your headset to broadcast to me, too.
【Masaya】
Oh...
【Asuka】
You're so passionate, Coach!
【Masaya】
Knock it off! You're embarrassing me!
【Asuka】
You were so cool... So, can we end the match here?
【Masaya】
Sure. I think you got your point across, Asuka.
Asuka approaches Rika.
【Asuka】
I'm sorry for being so mean, Rika-chan!
【Rika】
Whoa, Asuka-san...!
Asuka's bow is really deep, to the point where I'm worrying about her poor spine.
【Asuka】
If I told you in advance, I didn't think it would have done much good...
【Rika】
Thank you so much!
Now it's Rika's turn to bow deeply to Asuka.
【Rika】
I now know that the way I've been going about FC is all wrong. My thoughts are too single-minded.
【Asuka】
No problem! If you have fun and fly just like you do in practice, I'm sure you can beat anyone, even Kurobuchi-san!
【Rika】
Yes! At least, <i>now</i> I think I can win.
【Misaki】
Man, Asuka was getting so carried away that I started getting scared...
【Asuka】
Huh? I was? But I thought I was taking it pretty seriously...
【Rika】
If you were serious about what you said back there, then you're heading in a bad direction...
【Asuka】
N-No, no, no, no! That wasn't what I meant! I was just trying to say things to throw you off!
【Asuka】
A-Awww, please say something, Masaya-saaan...
【Masaya】
Well, uh, I think private matters are best sorted out in private...
【Asuka】
Why would you act all mature now?!
【Rika】
Hehehe, I know you didn't mean it... Thank you, seriously.
【Asuka】
U-Um, Rika-chan?
【Rika】
What is it?
【Asuka】
You don't, um, hate me now, do you?
【Rika】
Hehe, well, that depends on how you act from here on out... I guess?
【Asuka】
N-No way!
The first practice session in our second semester has proven to be a very valuable experience for Rika.
Though it <i>does</i> feel like she's holding some sort of grudge, so I decide to just make my escape.
I mean, what else can I do, really?
【Masaya】
Now that you're all here, there's something I'd like to say... Something I've been hiding.
This is our first after-practice meeting of the second term.
And so, what better time to clear the air.
【Asuka】
You have? What is it?
【Misaki】
Maybe he's been judging us based on the size of our boobs this whole time?
【Madoka】
Venti, grande, tall, short...
【Masaya】
What is this, Shitoubucks?! And for the record, I'm not judging any of you on your boobs!
By the way, Shitoubucks is a chain of coffee shops here in Shitou City.
I seriously doubt they got permission to use that name. I smell a lawsuit coming.
【Mashiro】
Huh, so then every time I talk, you mentally tag me as a short caramel macchiato? That's so cruel!
【Misaki】
Don't you think lattes feel more booby?
【Madoka】
Booby latte... Sounds kind of kinky, doesn't it?
【Asuka】
Do you think I'd be a venti or a grande?
【Madoka】
Tch... Straight to the top two options, huh? Oh, how great it must be to win the genetic lottery.
【Asuka】
Huh? I'm just asking...
【Mashiro】
Winners just don't understand, do they?
【Madoka】
They really don't. How sad that we have to continue our lives as a tall and a short.
【Masaya】
...So, do you think I can get to the point already?
This is getting out of hand...
【Everyone】
Fiiine!
【Asuka】
Fiiine!
【Misaki】
Fiiine!
【Mashiro】
Fiiine!
【Madoka】
Fiiine!
Silence at last.
Though I know it won't last long. In fact, I'm sure things'll get noisier than ever after my next announcement...
【Rika】
......
The other person involved with it looks nervous as well.
But I know we need to say this now, or it'll just complicate things down the line.
【Masaya】
(Screw it. Here goes nothing!)
It's now or never!
【Masaya】
Rika and I are dating!
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
...Huh?
Didn't expect this.
I expected them all to go nuts and bombard me with questions.
But everyone's just strangely silent. What the hell?
【Misaki】
Um, Masaya?
Misaki speaks up, unable to take the silence.
【Masaya】
Yes, what is it?
【Misaki】
Is that all you were hiding?
【Masaya】
Well, yeah...
【Misaki】
Oh...
Misaki's shoulders slump. She's clearly disappointed.
【Masaya】
Um, so guys, what's--
Madoka interrupts me.
【Madoka】
Uh, like, sorry, but... we all knew.
【Masaya/Rika】
Whaaaaaat?!
【Masaya】
Whaaaaaat?!
【Rika】
Whaaaaaat?!
Somehow, we're the most surprised ones in the room.
【Masaya】
But I didn't even tell anyone!
【Madoka】
You didn't need to... It was pretty obvious.
【Mashiro】
Seeing you together in the clubroom was more than enough.
【Misaki】
I mean, you two always stayed behind together, or you came up with reasons to practice late...
【Masaya】
Well, yeah, I'm Rika's coach.
【Misaki】
But you also stare at her the whoooooole time she's flying.
【Masaya】
Ugh...
【Madoka】
You always look at her while she's warming up too.
【Masaya】
Aww...
【Mashiro】
You stare at her while she's resting as well. You should see the grin on your face, Senpai.
【Masaya】
G-Give me a break already...
Goddammit!
Now I look like an idiot for thinking it was ever a secret!
【Asuka】
Um... actually, I sort of had an inkling myself.
【Masaya】
Wait, seriously?!
【Asuka】
It was just a hunch, but seeing the way you two act around each other, I figured it might be true.
【Rika】
So then, what you said during the match...
【Asuka】
I-I'm sorry! I just wanted to see how you'd react...
What the fuck.
Like, what the actual fuck.
Do they have any idea how hard it was to say that? They're making all my work worthless!
I should be happy that no one's taking it poorly.
But this is kind of a letdown...
【Rika】
I'm sorry that I ended up in a relationship with your coach.
【Misaki】
Oh, that's fine. You can take him.
【Madoka】
Just lend him to us when you have time.
【Mashiro】
I'm fine with you keeping him forever.
【Asuka】
I hope the two of you will be happy!
That's what I'm talking about. Asuka's genuine response almost bringing me to tears notwithstanding, of course.
【Masaya】
Well, I guess we'll move to the main topic, then.
【Misaki】
Huuuh? Isn't this the part where we get to interrogate you?!
【Madoka】
Yeah, give us the deets!
【Masaya】
Are you trying to kill me?!
I'm gonna have to be <i>really</i> careful. It'd be a disaster if they got any dirt on me.
...Probably.
【Masaya】
Right, so about the fall tournament.
We're going to decide on our goals for the fall tournament now.
Due to everything that happened over summer break, we haven't really had a chance to go over it yet.
【Masaya】
I was thinking now's a good time to decide on our main goals.
I write "Make the top four" on the whiteboard.
【Asuka】
The top four, huh...?
【Misaki】
That's pretty tough.
【Mashiro】
At this point, I feel like I've lost already.
【Madoka】
Hm, having an ambitious goal is all well and good, but don't you think this is a bit <i>too</i> much, Coach?
【Masaya】
Look closer.
I point to the text above "Make the top four."
【Misaki】
Huh? There's something <i>really</i> tiny up there.
【Mashiro】
Hm... I can't read it. It's too faint.
【Rika】
Oh, I see it! It says "including Takafuji"...?
【Misaki】
Huuuh...?
【Mashiro】
What...?
【Madoka】
Hm...
They don't seem to like this.
【Misaki】
I mean, we <i>did</i> practice together, so in a way, it kinda feels like we're the same club...
【Mashiro】
This still feels like cheating.
【Madoka】
You're the kind of guy who'd back all the horses in a horse race to keep yourself from being a loser, huh?
Wow, rude much?
【Masaya】
Look, I have an actual reason for this.
【Misaki】
Explain.
【Masaya】
As you all know, the Kurobuchi incident has kept Takafuji from practicing for quite a while.
【Mashiro】
But that's all done now, isn't it?
【Masaya】
Yeah, <i>now</i> being the key word there. That doesn't change the fact that they've had less time to practice.
And less practice usually leads to worse results.
Sure, things like a week of specialized training can help people compete, but that's not the case here.
Practicing less in general, or not at all, harms a person's ability to play.
And there wasn't much time between the summer and fall tournaments to begin with, so it's made things hard for them.
【Rika】
I'm sorry... This is all my school's fault...
【Misaki】
Oh, come on, it's got nothing to do with you, Rika-chan.
【Asuka】
She's right, this isn't your problem!
【Rika】
But--
【Mashiro】
It's fine. We just have to work together now.
【Masaya】
Yeah, like Mashiro said, that's what we're gonna do.
【Mashiro】
Huh...?
【Masaya】
There will be no "Takafuji" or "Kunahama" at this tournament. I want us to work together.
Tackling this separately will just lead to all of us exposing our weaknesses earlier.
So this time, and this time alone, we'll work together. That should help us achieve the results we desire.
【Misaki】
...I get it.
【Asuka】
It all makes sense... We can share our hardships, and get through it with the power of numbers!
【Mashiro】
In that case, I think aiming for the top four makes sense.
【Madoka】
It's decided, then!
【Rika】
...Yes!
【Masaya】
Good. This is our target for the next tournament!
And so, the Kunahama FC Club has decided on a goal for the fall tournament.
There's less than a month before it begins, so this should help raise morale.
All that's left to do is train up everyone's techniques, thought processes, and mental fortitude as much as possible.
There's a mountain of things we have to do, but I believe it'll turn out well.
【Satouin】
...You never fail to come up with the most interesting of ideas.
【Masaya】
Should I take that as a compliment?
【Satouin】
Partially, perhaps. Honestly, I'm somewhat dumbfounded.
【Masaya】
Sorry.
【Satouin】
Schools are allotted a fixed number of entrants per tournament, so simply having more students doesn't give us an advantage.
【Masaya】
You're correct.
【Satouin】
However, it will be most stimulating for us at Takafuji, and give us another good opportunity to observe players from other schools.
【Satouin】
...I believe this joint objective between our schools to be a good idea. Thus, I, Satouin, president of our club, approve of it.
【Masaya】
Thank you very much.
【Satouin】
However, simply agreeing upon on a joint goal is no fun at all. I require something more...
【Masaya】
I had a feeling you'd say that.
【Satouin】
Huh?
【Masaya】
So, now that we've agreed on a joint goal, I'd like to suggest that we hold another joint training camp.
【Satouin】
......
【Satouin】
You <i>have</i> thought this through, then.
【Masaya】
I'll take that as a half-compliment again.
【Satouin】
By the way, how is Ichinose-san doing?
【Masaya】
Oh, she's doing great. I think she might place pretty high at the fall tournament.
【Satouin】
What wonderful news... Though, at this rate, she might get too comfortable around you and never return to Takafuji.
【Masaya】
Th-That won't happen.
【Satouin】
Ohohohoho, I'm merely joking.
That didn't sound like a joke to me...
Satouin-san's face immediately shifts back to a serious one.
【Satouin】
...We do need that girl here at Takafuji. I'll be sure to bring her back after the fall tournament.
【Masaya】
Yeah, I figured that'd be a good time too.
【Satouin】
I wonder what Ichinose-san will be able to teach us upon her return, after having received your guidance, Masaya Hinata.
【Satouin】
I'm looking forward to it.
【Masaya】
I'm looking forward to it as well.
Though I feel it's better to say she's learned from everyone at Kunahama.
Well, that aside, I'm real interested in how things will turn out when it's Rika's turn to do the teaching.
Maybe I'll have Satouin-san let me observe it in secret. Though, I feel Rika wouldn't be too happy about that.
【Masaya】
Okay, I should get going.
【Satouin】
My, leaving so soon? You really did only come here to discuss that matter, then.
【Masaya】
Yes... There's still one more person I have to speak to.
【Satouin】
Hm...?
【Aoi】
I see. So you'll be trying to make the top four alongside Takafuji, huh?
【Masaya】
Yes.
After talking to Satouin-san, I report our decision to our advisor, Aoi-san.
Honestly, this is what I'm most worried about. Sure, we have our reasons, but we've basically lowered our initial goal.
I'm fully prepared for her to reject the proposal.
【Aoi】
Okay, good luck. Come see me if you ever any need help.
Wait, what? She's accepting our decision far more easily than I ever could have imagined.
【Masaya】
Aoi-san.
【Aoi】
What?
【Masaya】
Is that all? Really?
【Aoi】
Like I said before, there's nothing else for me to say. This is your decision, Masaya.
She doesn't seem angry at all.
If anything, she seems to truly believe in her answer.
【Aoi】
You said that you felt something similar to you in Ichinose when you decided to coach her, right?
【Masaya】
Right.
【Aoi】
Have you saved her?
【Masaya】
I'm still in the process... but I think I'm helping her, at least.
【Aoi】
I see. That's good to hear.
【Masaya】
I...
【Aoi】
Hm?
【Masaya】
I still remembered what you did for me, Aoi-san.
【Aoi】
Did something bad happen? You can always come to me if something's wrong.
Yes, it all started back then.
And so, I can never forget those words Aoi-san said to me.
But now, I want to repeat them to someone else who's stuck in the same place I once was.
【Aoi】
......
【Aoi】
You still remember all that?
【Masaya】
Yes... It's too bad I wasn't able to accept your offer.
【Aoi】
Don't worry about it. Neither of us were being honest with ourselves back then.
【Masaya】
But--
【Aoi】
You're only qualified to help Ichinose because of how things turned out, right?
【Aoi】
...That makes it all okay.
【Masaya】
...Right.
I pathetically brushed aside the hand that Aoi-san painstakingly extended toward me.
I kept my problems bottled up because of my pitiful pride, and before I knew it, I'd lost my place to belong.
So, if there's anything I can do, I'll do it.
Because I don't want Rika to end up like me.
【Aoi】
Nothing is ever pointless in life.
【Aoi】
...I feel like you taught me that today, Masaya.
【Masaya】
I did...?
【Aoi】
Yes, you've grown. Far more than I have, even.
【Masaya】
Oh, I, uh... don't know about that...
I know she's referring to something specific, just not what.
【Aoi】
You show consideration for the weak, both with Ichinose and now your joint goal with Takafuji.
【Aoi】
Only people with experience and innate kindness can do that.
【Aoi】
I think it's a wonderful thing.
【Masaya】
...Thank you very much.
Honestly, I understand what Aoi-san is saying, but I'm not sure if I'm as capable as she says.
Still, I agree that I've grown. At least now I can see value in things other than winning.
【Aoi】
Maybe I should be taking teaching lessons from you.
【Masaya】
Y-You're going <i>way</i> too far, Aoi-san.
【Aoi】
Haha, I'm counting on you, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Sheesh...
【Masaya】
So yeah, everyone agreed.
That evening, I tell Rika about how everything went.
Apparently both of her parents will be home late, so I've been allowed in her room despite the time.
【Rika】
I see. Satouin-senpai did too...
Rika smiles when I tell her about Satouin-san.
【Masaya】
Come to think of it, I never did ask you, Rika.
【Rika】
Oh?
【Masaya】
What kind of person is Satouin-san?
【Rika】
Senpai is, hm...
【Rika】
It's hard to describe her, but she's a very considerate person.
【Rika】
Naturally, this means she's very popular. And she always shows concern for everyone's wellbeing, so our club members love her.
【Masaya】
Yeah, I get that.
【Rika】
There is one thing I dislike about her, though.
【Masaya】
Oh, what's that?
【Rika】
Senpai always uses "-san" when referring to anyone younger than her. I know she isn't an arrogant person, but...
Yeah, she definitely comes off arrogant at times.
But I know her well enough to know that isn't true.
【Rika】
It makes me a bit sad sometimes, thinking about how she's keeping a distance between us all. Though, I suppose I might just be overthinking things.
【Masaya】
Right... You're so diligent, Rika, I bet she's never gotten angry at you.
【Rika】
Yes, the most I've gotten is a light scolding.
【Masaya】
I'd kinda like to see that happen. Her getting mad at you, I mean.
【Rika】
...That would be terrifying.
【Masaya】
Yeah, I can see that.
I can imagine the underclassmen bursting into tears at the sight of such an imposing girl flying into a fit of rage.
Hm, maybe she knows that, which is why she tries to remain calm at all times?
【Rika】
Um, Masaya-san.
【Masaya】
Yeah?
【Rika】
I'm really happy about our goal.
【Masaya】
Yeah... I didn't want whatever we decided on to stress people out.
【Rika】
This goal isn't stressful at all.
【Masaya】
Glad to hear that.
【Rika】
Right...
【Rika】
You've taught me so many new things, Masaya-san. I'm glad I've finally realized that not everything is about winning or losing.
I didn't come up with a joint goal for any special reason.
I just wanted to lower the pressure on my players' shoulders.
If other good things happen as a result of that, then perhaps I really have grown.
【Masaya】
(Is this what you meant, Aoi-san?)
I really do wonder...
Though I'm sure I won't get a real answer for a while.
【Rika】
So, what should we do next weekend, Masaya-san?
【Masaya】
Hm...
We've decided on a goal for the tournament, and adjusted our training schedule accordingly.
However, though Takafuji's agreed to a joint training camp, it hasn't actually started just yet.
And that means we have a very small gap in our schedules.
【Masaya】
Rika, tomorrow's Sunday.
【Rika】
Yes, it is. What about it?
【Masaya】
...Wanna go on a date?
【Rika】
Yes, a date. Of course.
【Rika】
......
【Rika】
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
【Masaya】
Why are you so surprised?
Her reaction would've been more appropriate for a plot twist like, "Shindou-san was a girl all along" or something.
【Rika】
I-I mean, you're talking about going on a date! The t-two of us will be alone, in public!
【Rika】
Oh! Perhaps what you <i>really</i> meant to say was a double date--
【Masaya】
It'll be just the two of us.
【Rika】
Aww...
【Masaya】
If you don't wa--
【Rika】
P-Please wait a moment!
Rika cuts me off.
【Rika】
Could you just give me five minutes?!
【Masaya】
S-Sure. Take as long as you need.
【Rika】
Thank you. Please wait a moment!
Rika stops me in my tracks and whips out her prized laptop.
That's the one she uses to update her blog, right?
Hm, I think this is the first time I've seen her using it in front of me.
We spend most of our time together talking, so she's never really had a reason to use it before.
【Rika】
Now I can go without making any compromises!
Rika's dead serious.
She's staring at the screen so hard that I'm starting to get curious.
【Masaya】
What are you looking at...?
Let's take a quick peek...
【Rika】
Wh-What do you think you're doing?!
Rika gets angry and forces me back into my seat.
【Masaya】
Huh? Oh, sorry...
Wait, why'd I apologize? I didn't even do anything wrong!
【Rika】
Sheesh... You mustn't! A girl's laptop is filled with indescribable secrets!
Uh, what? It is?
But that just makes me wanna look more...
What's she writing?
【Masaya】
(Maybe it's about me?)
Thinking about it too hard will give me a migraine, so I better stop here.
【Rika】
Hm... There aren't any big events going on tomorrow.
【Masaya】
That's perfect.
Whenever big events happen on this island, flight areas get restricted.
【Rika】
It doesn't seem like we'll have any issues going to Iron Mall... If anything, it should be relatively quiet.
【Masaya】
Hey, wait, you've already decided we're going to Iron Mall?
【Rika】
Yes... If that's fine with you, Masaya-san.
【Masaya】
Oh, sure...
There's nothing <i>particularly</i> wrong with that, I guess?
It's just, we're finally going on a real date, but she wants to go somewhere we've been already... Seems kinda lame, you know?
【Rika】
Let's enjoy ourselves!
Rika runs her hands over the mouse and keyboard like a pro.
It's weird how good she is at this, when you consider how much trouble her internet connection was giving her at one point.
【Rika】
All that's left is checking the weather...
【Rika】
Yay, perfect! It's supposed to be sunny tomorrow!
Rika's serious expression has been gradually softening.
【Masaya】
So, um...
【Rika】
Yes?
【Masaya】
You still haven't actually given me an answer.
【Rika】
Ah!
Rika's eyes widen as she realizes her mistake.
【Rika】
W-Well, I mean...
Her expression is more serious than I've ever seen.
【Rika】
I'd love to. It would make me the happiest woman in the world.
She finally answers.
【Masaya】
That settles it, then. Wanna head out at ten?
【Rika】
Okay!
【Masaya】
Well, guess I should get home and rest up.
I stand up, and am about to head to the door, when...
【Rika】
Masaya-san.
Rika stops me in place.
【Masaya】
Hm?
【Rika】
I'm <i>really</i> happy you asked me on a date... I love you.
【Rika】
So, good night!
【Masaya】
N-Night...
I'd been planning on having Sunday be a day off, anyway.
Too much practice kills motivation, especially in the cases of Misaki and Mashiro.
I'm just glad that Rika's even more happy about my invitation than I thought.
【Masaya】
"I love you," huh?
【Masaya】
Holy shit... How do three simple words hold so much power?
【Masaya】
It's hard to keep myself from grinning like a fool... Gotta try and sleep.
The next day.
The skies are as clear as Rika said.
【Masaya】
The weather's perfect...
Normally, I'd say this is perfect weather for FC, but not today.
The clock has finally hit ten.
【Masaya】
Okay... Let's go!
I kick my tense body into action and walk out of my house.
【Rika】
Good... morning.
Rika's already waiting outside.
She isn't wearing her uniform today.
【Masaya】
Morning.
【Rika】
I'm kind of nervous.
Guess we're in the same boat.
【Masaya】
Haven't we met in front of our houses like this before?
【Rika】
We have. And coincidentally, we were going to the same place...
【Rika】
But today's not a coincidence, is it?
【Masaya】
Nope.
Today's the first time we've arranged to go somewhere together in advance.
This is all so new, which makes it exciting.
【Rika】
Let's get going.
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Masaya】
I'm kinda surprised.
【Rika】
About where we're going?
Rika checked online, then said she wanted to go to Iron Mall, which is where everyone always goes.
I'd considered it a possible option, so I didn't object, but I can't say I expected it either.
【Masaya】
Yeah, we can go to Iron Mall whenever.
【Rika】
W-Well, I... do have a reason.
【Masaya】
You do?
【Rika】
I-It's a secret. I... can't tell you yet...
【Masaya】
O-Oh, okay...
I wonder what it could be?
Before long, we arrive at Iron Mall.
It's Sunday, so there are families all over the place. Plus, there are also some other couples around.
There's a show based on a popular kids' anime going on in the lobby, meaning it's crowded with people.
The booth for lost children is already taking action, with a store attendant desperately trying to soothe a sobbing girl.
This is just like every weekend at Iron Mall.
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
Now, where'd Rika run off to?
There are multiple reasons that I'm looking around the mall.
Number One: The moment we got here, Rika ran off on her own. (She said: "Please wait right there!")
Number Two: She hasn't come back yet. (She never even gave a timeframe, actually.)
Number Three: There's nothing else I can do to kill time. (All the stores I'm interested in are on the second floor.)
【Masaya】
Maybe she wanted to pick up something from a nearby store?
No, she would've just asked me to tag along if that was true.
Left with nothing else to do, I kill time people watching.
【Rika】
Masaya-san!
Rika finally returns, completely out of breath.
【Rika】
I'm sorry I made you wait so long!
【Masaya】
Oh, it's fine, but what got into-- Oh!
Bags full of piping hot chicken swing from each of Rika's hands.
【Masaya】
You... went to buy those?
【Rika】
Yes!
She gives me an incredibly cheerful reply.
These bags are from a different store. Instead of "Chickenlicious," they say, "TLC: Tendies, Love, and Care."
Even ignoring that terrible pun, this does seem to be different from what we had last time.
【Masaya】
This isn't the same chicken, huh?
【Rika】
Yes, they have a new shop today, and I really really wanted to try it!
Rika's so happy about this chicken that you'd think she's talking about clothes or jewelry.
【Masaya】
Is this why you wanted to come to Iron Mall?
【Rika】
Y-Yes...
She mutters, clearly embarrassed.
【Rika】
I couldn't admit that my main goal was this fried chicken, so...
【Masaya】
So you suggested we come here for our date.
I don't mind that she wanted this fried chicken, but it is a rather odd match for her personality.
【Rika】
B-But this fried chicken really is amazing!
She thrusts the bags in front of my eyes.
【Rika】
It's a famous store in Furuya City that's apparently every bit as good as the ones in Nakatsu City! It always gets four or five stars on yelp!
【Rika】
Apparently it has a more mature, sweet and salty taste, but the owner keeps the sauce a secret. This is its first time appearing in Shitou City!
【Rika】
Knowing all that, I was <i>super</i> interested in checking it out, and when I found out they were opening a store here, I knew I just had to come, so when the chance came to do it with you, I just...
Rika finally notices the dumbfounded expression on my face.
【Rika】
A-Aww... Ahem!
【Rika】
A-Anyway, have a bite!
Rika holds the bag out toward me.
【Masaya】
Sure, thanks...
This is all <i>way</i> too familiar... Regardless, I grab a piece of chicken and pop it into my mouth.
【Masaya】
Oh... This is good.
The sauce is much richer than it was last time, to the point where I feel like I'm getting addicted already.
The meat tears off the bone easily too, which enhances the experience. I get why people line up for this.
【Rika】
Right? It's great!
Still, no one would expect her to be in that line...
I'm sure she stuck out like a sore thumb.
【Masaya】
It is great, but...
【Rika】
Yes?
【Masaya】
Rika, like...
The pieces of the puzzle all start coming together.
She looks up fried chicken joints online, she has plushies of cows, pigs, and chickens in her room...
Her specialty dishes are pork stew, pork saute, and stir-fried liver...
There's only one possibility.
【Masaya】
You... love meat, huh?
【Rika】
Ah...!
The wing Rika's raising to her mouth freezes in the air as she begins trembling.
An expression of grief washes over her face as she holds that awkward, yet impressive, pose.
【Rika】
You... figured me out?
I mean, it was kinda obvious...
【Masaya】
It's fine, just eat already.
【Rika】
Oh, okay!
Rika finally drops the chicken into her mouth.
【Rika】
Mmmmmmmmm!
A delighted smile forms on her face.
【Rika】
Haaah...
And immediately following that, she looks dejected.
What an odd girl.
【Rika】
I knew you'd figure it out eventually, but I thought I could keep it hidden for a little longer...
【Masaya】
It was pretty obvious.
【Rika】
Masaya-san... Is it wrong that I love meat?
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Rika】
Well, I mean, it's strange, isn't it? For someone to love meat this much...
【Masaya】
I don't really think so... I love meat too.
It's a little unusual to be this obsessed, but not unheard of.
I don't judge her for it, anyway.
【Rika】
Wh-What a relief!
She looks really, <i>really</i> happy right now.
【Rika】
I didn't know what I'd do if you thought it was strange!
【Rika】
This is such a relief. Plus, knowing that you love meat just as much makes me so happy!
【Rika】
Right, why don't you try one of these salted win-- Wait, Masaya-san?
Rika goes off into her own little world and starts rambling again, but she suddenly stops once she notices the expression on my face.
【Masaya】
You know, Rika...
【Rika】
Y-Yes...?
【Masaya】
You're a real airhead at times. It's adorable.
【Rika】
Ah...!
Rika trembles as she slams her body into me.
【Masaya】
Hahaha, sorry.
I apologize, but she doesn't stop.
【Rika】
Ugh, this is embarrassing... It's so embarrassing...
She keeps repeating to herself.
【Rika】
We sure bought a lot.
【Masaya】
More than I thought we would, even...
I'm just glad we managed to fit everything in one bag.
Now, all we have to do is separate our stuff when we get home. Being neighbors sure comes in handy.
【Masaya】
So, is this the shop we're going to next?
【Rika】
Yes, that's the one. If we walk straight...
Rika points directly ahead.
According to the map, it's only a few hundred meters away, so we should arrive soon.
Rika and I walk by the arcade.
【Rika】
......
I'm holding our bags, but Rika is staring at it as we walk.
【Masaya】
Hm? What, wanna get something out the bag?
【Rika】
Oh, no, that's not what I was thinking.
【Rika】
Shouldn't I carry some of our stuff too?
【Masaya】
Nah, it's cool.
It's not all that heavy, so I'm good.
【Rika】
No, um... I mean, I'd like us to hold it together.
Oh...
【Masaya】
That's what you mean? Sorry.
【Rika】
You don't have to apologize.
Now that I realize what Rika means, I temporarily let go of the bag.
Then, I link it between our held hands.
【Masaya】
...Is this what you wanted?
【Rika】
It is.
Seems I did the right thing, since Rika's aiming a beaming smile at me.
【Rika】
It feels like we're a real couple now. I love it.
【Masaya】
Yeah, same.
We hold hands all the time.
But this slight change is enough to make it all feel new and exciting.
【Rika】
I've always wanted to try this.
【Masaya】
Yeah... I know what you mean.
I start thinking about how incredible it is to have a girlfriend. Even small, inconsequential things like this make me stupidly happy.
But now that we're at this point, I have the urge to go further.
【Masaya】
Rika... There's something I'd like to do.
【Rika】
Oh? Sure.
【Masaya】
I want to change the way we're holding the bags.
【Rika】
You do?
【Masaya】
Yeah... Let's try this!
【Rika】
Ah...!
I link my fingers with Rika as I hold her hand.
Now we're holding hands just like they do in the movies.
【Masaya】
...If you wanna say something, go right ahead.
【Rika】
No, I'm good... Hehe...
【Masaya】
Maybe we should stop.
【Rika】
Huh? But we just started... Let's stay like this a bit longer.
【Masaya】
If you laugh again, I'm stopping.
【Rika】
Sheesh, I won't laugh. It's just...
【Rika】
I'm so happy right now.
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
Kinda feels like you've got me totally whipped, Rika.
【Rika】
Hehehe, you're just imagining things!
【Rika】
And now we're home.
【Masaya】
Man, time flies when you're having fun.
【Rika】
It sure does.
We continued shopping for a while, then had some tea while chatting.
And before we knew it, it was evening.
"Time really flies when you're having fun."
That phrase feels truer than ever today.
【Masaya】
Do you wanna talk through our windows later?
【Rika】
Oh, actually, do you still have time today?
【Masaya】
Huh? Yeah, I've got nothing planned.
【Rika】
Then there's something I'd like to ask of you...
Rika's request is a simple one.
She just wants me to watch her practice.
We've flown the whole way home together, but something feels special about us practicing now.
We change into our practice gear, then once again take to the starry sky.
【Masaya】
That's it, stabilize both your legs... Go slowly.
【Rika】
Okay!
I support Rika's back as I check her form.
【Masaya】
Don't move your arms to fix your balance. Shift your center of gravity to keep yourself stable.
【Rika】
Understood!
We do our regular practice session, then continue our date by flying further than normal.
【Rika】
Have you ever been to that mountain over there?
【Masaya】
Yeah, I used to go play there all the time. There's a lighthouse that looks real beautiful.
【Rika】
...Shall we go take a look?
【Masaya】
Sure, let's go.
【Rika】
...It's been ages since I've had this much fun.
Rika suddenly mutters those words as we're flying around.
【Masaya】
You talking about our date?
Rika nods.
【Rika】
I've spent so long working at Takafuji...
【Masaya】
Well, yeah, but you must have gone out with friends and stuff, right?
Rika seemed to get along with the other members of her club during practice, so I assumed they were friends.
They didn't seem to faking anything, at least.
【Rika】
I have, but I've always put the club first in my mind.
【Masaya】
I see...
I thought she was getting along with her friends at Takafuji, but maybe that's not the case?
Actually, I don't think that's quite right.
Even when she hangs out with her friends, because this is Rika we're talking about, she probably ends up unconsciously putting up a filter.
So I guess having someone like me, who she can just be herself around, is really important to her.
【Rika】
I used to have friends like that.
Well, this is a surprise.
Rika's had a lot of chances to tell me about her past, but she's choosing this moment for whatever reason.
She said she didn't wanna talk about it until she was ready, so I never pressed the issue.
Though, that doesn't mean I wasn't curious.
【Masaya】
At the last school you were at?
Rika nods.
【Rika】
I told you I lived in Kanoshima, right?
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Rika】
I had great friends there. Maho-chan, Suzu-chan, Akina-chan... We played FC together at Kirishima Central Academy.
【Rika】
And we still keep in contact, so we're all still friends.
【Masaya】
Oh, so when you said "everyone" before, you were talking about your friends from Kirishima?
I recall the word slipping out of her mouth and her trying to play it off back when she'd first started practicing at Kunahama.
Just now, I manage to work out that she was thinking of her friends from Kirishima Central.
【Rika】
Yes, that's right... Back then, I wanted to show my friends how hard I could work.
A happy smile forms on Rika's face.
But it soon clouds over.
【Rika】
...There is one thing that still bothers me, though.
【Masaya】
What's that?
【Rika】
I had one more friend back in Kanoshima who was really important to me. A girl named Sacchan.
【Rika】
...She was the one who introduced FC to me in the first place.
【Masaya】
Did she teach you?
Rika nods.
【Rika】
Yes. She taught me all about the sport of Flying Circus, and we practiced together every single day.
【Rika】
We went our separate ways when it was time for us to move schools, but at that moment, we made a promise.
【Masaya】
Oh?
【Rika】
It was one of those silly, childish promises. We said we'd continue playing FC, and someday meet again in the skies.
【Rika】
She's probably forgotten all about it by now, since this was several years ago...
【Rika】
I'm probably the only one who's still thinking about it even now.
I see...
Rika's a hard worker. She's the hardest worker I know, even.
But at her core, she's a lot like me.
【Rika】
Hahaha, this is all pretty lame, isn't it?
Rika mocks herself with her laughter.
I keep my expression still, listening to her in silence.
【Masaya】
Not at all.
【Rika】
Huh?
【Masaya】
The past is important. It can trap you, but it can also save you.
I know that a person's past can be so harsh that they don't want to ever speak of it.
However, I also know that the promise Rika made with her friend is something precious.
【Masaya】
Honestly, hearing about your past has just made me fall in love with you all over again.
【Rika】
......
Rika's expression makes it clear that she's struggling to remain calm.
【Masaya】
I love how much you value the past.
【Rika】
Masaya-san...!
Rika calls my name.
It looks like she's about to burst into tears...
【Rika】
Mmm... Mmmph...
I pull her into a tight hug, then kiss her as we hover in the air.
Tears stream down her face, dripping onto mine.
【Masaya】
Rika... Rika...
I rub my cheeks against hers as if to wipe away the tears.
I want to show her that I'm willing to wipe away all of her tears, no matter when or where.
Our lips press together and our tongues intertwine as I attempt to soothe her with a kiss.
【Rika】
I love you... I love you so much... Masaya-san...
【Masaya】
Mmm... I love you too...
【Rika】
I love you... I love you... I love you...
Inside her brave exterior sits an incredibly lonely girl.
One that simply doesn't move, no matter who calls out to her.
She'll say that she's fine, but no one can tell if that's true.
Hopefully, I've finally managed to reach her.
Since now, I'm in a place where I can reach out a hand to stroke her head, and tell her everything is going to be okay.
【Rika】
Masaya-san... I'm so glad you're here.
Nothing particularly dramatic has happened, and no intense calamity has befallen her.
But that's exactly why nobody's reached out a helping hand to her yet. They all thought she was fine.
She was so good at hiding her feelings that no one thought it was even necessary to help.
And that's why I've decided to put her before everything.
From now on, I'll do everything for her.
What is an honor student? What does it mean to be a good girl? What is a genius? How can you say possibly say someone's been blessed?
There are tons of things in this world that you can't understand until you're right beside them.
The two of us continue to kiss, and seemingly melt together.
You could even say we're getting to know each other all over again, understanding the pasts that brought us to this mutual present.
We can understand each other through more than just words.
And so, our kisses drag on endlessly.
After our date, we return to my room.
I sit down on the bed. Instead of sitting beside me, Rika plops herself down between my legs.
She has a habit of snuggling up to me whenever we're alone.
It's pretty damn adorable.
I stroke her head and rub her shoulders as the two of us look through a fashion magazine.
【Masaya】
Say, I was gonna get you a present, Rika. What do you want?
【Rika】
Hm...
【Masaya】
Mmm...
【Rika】
Mmmph, mmm, mnnn, mmmph... Hehehee...
【Masaya】
No, kisses don't count.
I couldn't stop myself after the look she gave me.
【Rika】
I think I'd be happy with anything you gave me, Masaya-san.
【Masaya】
Come on, don't just say that. There must be something.
【Rika】
I just mean I'll be fine with whatever you buy. As long as you keep me in mind and think it over carefully, I'll be the happiest girl in the world.
【Rika】
Just imagining you doing that makes my heart all fluttery...
【Masaya】
Suddenly, picking out a present for you has turned into the hardest task in my life...
【Rika】
I might even mention it on my blog.
【Masaya】
You don't have to announce it to the whole world...
【Rika】
Hehe, I was only joking.
Rika pokes her tongue out mischievously.
【Rika】
Is there something you'd like, Masaya-san?
【Masaya】
Hm...
I think about it carefully.
But as do, I see the fashion magazine.
【Masaya】
...You'd look good dressed up as Santa in a mini skirt.
【Rika】
Huh?
【Masaya】
Or a policewoman, a nurse, a businesswoman in a suit... Even a chairman with red-rimmed glasses.
【Rika】
Um, what are you talking about?
【Masaya】
You're incredible, Rika. I think you'd look good in anything.
【Rika】
Oh, you're dressing me up inside your head, aren't you? Sheesh, all I did was ask what present you'd like.
【Masaya】
Yeah, that's the whole point! There's literally no better present!
【Rika】
So this is what you're into, huh? I can sort of understand the appeal of cute uniforms, I suppose...
【Rika】
I see... I see.
【Masaya】
It's almost weird how okay you are with all this.
【Rika】
Oh, I was just thinking that I should keep that in mind before I settle on a job.
【Masaya】
Don't base your life on that...
【Rika】
But you're already the most important factor in all of my decisions, Masaya-san. I'll do anything to make you happy.
I'm happy to hear that, but she <i>really</i> shouldn't be basing her career on my fetishes...
【Masaya】
You already do tons for me, Rika.
【Rika】
But it's not enough. I don't feel satisfied.
I get the feeling that I should drop this topic before I do any serious damage to her.
...I've got it!
【Masaya】
Do you mind listening to my biggest request of all?
【Rika】
Your biggest... O-Okay, if it's something I can do, I <i>definitely</i> will!
The day of the tournament is drawing near.
It's three days away, whether we like it or not. We'll have to lay it all out on the table soon enough.
We've been practicing our hearts out, honing individual techniques and competing in practice matches.
And in one such match...
Asuka forces her way into Rika's path as she's flying at full speed while trying to throw in a feint.
【Asuka】
I'm aiming for your head!
【Rika】
I won't let you!
Rika tries to shake off Asuka with a Low Yo-Yo.
【Asuka】
Take this!
Asuka shoots past her, as Rika had intended, but...
【Rika】
Ngh, nghhh...
Pants leak from Rika's tightly closed lips.
【Asuka】
Huh?
Rika forces her body to twist upward, suddenly dropping in speed as she shifts from a descent into a climb.
【Asuka】
Wh-What?!
Rika's speed may have dropped, but regaining her form has given her a huge burst of speed, allowing her to easily pass over Asuka's head.
【Rika】
Yeah! I made it!
【Masaya】
Nice! That was perfect!
【Rika】
Thank you so much!
【Asuka】
Aww, she totally beat me!
【Rika】
I did it! I think that's the first time I've ever managed to get past Asuka-san like that.
【Masaya】
Now that you mention it, you might be right.
【Asuka】
That's not true at all. You've passed me loads of times, haven't you?
【Rika】
Well, yes, but not in the same way.
It's not like Rika's never gotten past Asuka before.
But it was always through force. Overwhelming her with speed was her only viable strategy.
This is probably the first time she's actually managed to successfully use a feint.
And it wasn't just luck. All of Rika's hard work has finally paid off.
And not just hers, but everyone else's as well.
Everyone's help has made her improve leaps and bounds.
【Masaya】
Okay. Rika, return to the buoy. Asuka, you wait for her nearby. Let's take it from the top one more time.
【Asuka】
I won't let you pass me this time!
【Rika】
I'll do my best to get through!
【Satouin】
Is everything proceeding well?
【Masaya】
Huh? Oh, it's you, Satouin-san. And Shindou-san, too.
【Shindou】
Hey, how's it going? We came to see how they're doing.
【Masaya】
You came to see Rika, right?
【Satouin】
Well, she hasn't been showing up at Takafuji. We do trust you, but we still wish to remain informed.
【Satouin】
I trust she's not causing any problems?
【Masaya】
No problem at all. It's the same as always around here, really. We all value her presence a lot.
...She keeps the clubroom nice and tidy, so how can we even complain?
Not that I'm about to say that. They might start doubting our motives if I do.
【Satouin】
Really now? You're not lying to me, are you?
【Masaya】
I wouldn't lie about something like that.
【Satouin】
Oh, well that's good.
Shindou-san smiles.
【Shindou】
Satou-kun can be rather overprotective.
【Satouin】
M-Me, overprotective? H-How preposterous!
Satouin-san is so embarrassed that she forgets to call him out on not using the right name.
【Satouin】
I simply need to ensure that Ichinose-san is representing Takafuji well.
【Shindou】
That counts as overprotective, if you ask me.
【Satouin】
No, I'm telling you that--
【Masaya】
You came at the perfect time. Rika's flying right now, so why don't we go see how she's doing?
Satouin-san clears her throat.
【Satouin】
...That sounds wonderful.
【Satouin】
...Ichinose-san has improved quite a bit.
【Shindou】
Yeah, I agree. You can really see how far she's come. It's incredible.
【Satouin】
Indeed, she's gotten much better at regaining her form. Even more forced movements don't cause her to lose speed anymore.
【Shindou】
Well, color me impressed. Think you could tell me what kind of magic you used?
【Masaya】
There was no magic involved... If you're looking for a reason, I guess you could say this is all thanks to Kurobuchi.
【Satouin】
<i>Kasumi</i> Kurobuchi?
Satouin-san's face clouds over.
【Shindou】
What do you mean?
【Masaya】
Well, we shouldn't be thanking her or anything, but Rika's been giving it her all and practicing to face rougher opponents like Kurobuchi.
【Shindou】
Oh, I get it.
【Masaya】
Good.
Satouin-san shakes her head in exasperation.
【Satouin】
Would you mind explaining things to me before deciding that everything is clear?
【Shindou】
Playing rough in FC is all about being unafraid of losing your form while using techniques designed to destroy your opponents.
【Satouin】
Thank you for your thorough explanation. So, you're saying that in training to play against rough players, you learn how to restore your form as fast as possible?
【Masaya】
Exactly. I noticed that myself while making them practice.
【Shindou】
So that's the secret to throwing in feints without dropping your speed... It all makes sense now.
【Masaya】
That's not all, though. Her situational reaction speed has also gotten faster.
【Satouin】
I suppose that is thanks to the same training as well?
【Masaya】
That's right. What should I do? What's the current situation? What about my opponent? How far is it to the next buoy? Even when your form gets destroyed, you need to have a handle on all those questions.
Making even the slightest mistake can lead to your opponent racking up consecutive points.
We started training like this out of necessity, but surprisingly, though fortunately, it comes with a lot of benefits.
【Shindou】
We made the right decision, letting Ichinose-kun come here.
【Satouin】
We did. She probably wouldn't have grown this much if she had stayed at Takafuji, as much as I hate to admit it.
Satouin-san's expression stiffens, despite the smile on her face.
【Satouin】
However...
【Masaya】
What is it?
【Satouin】
Have you managed to train her mental fortitude?
【Shindou】
That's her biggest weakness.
【Masaya】
Unfortunately, not everything comes so easy.
【Satouin】
...Indeed.
Moments of surprise or foul play tend to make her weakness prominent.
【Masaya】
But...
【Shindou】
Yeah?
【Masaya】
Unlike before, she knows her weakness.
【Shindou】
Right. Other people may have pointed out her weakness in the past, but I doubt Ichinose-kun knew why it was a weakness in the first place.
On the surface, she may have understood that her overly-diligent personality was a weakness, but she never knew why.
Perhaps her diligent personality, or rather, the chains on her heart, stopped her from ever thinking of that.
But things are different now.
【Masaya】
I think her encounter with Kurobuchi helped her change.
She truly realized what happens when she gets confused, or what happens when she gets angry.
【Masaya】
Asuka's been forcing Rika to face her weakness during their practice sessions lately, so I think she's come to fully understand them.
【Satouin】
You say Asuka Kurashina is doing this?
【Masaya】
You probably already know this, but when Asuka gets serious, she's real scary.
【Shindou】
I see. So Ichinose-kun finally understands...
【Masaya】
I think she's facing up to them now as she practices.
If she isn't, there's no way she'd be practicing so hard.
【Satouin】
At this point, it's just a matter of seeing how far she can take it in a match, correct?
【Masaya】
Yeah, but we won't know that until the tournament actually begins.
The best players in practice matches can turn out to be completely average in tournaments.
In baseball, they call them bullpen aces. They're players who do great in practice, but suck out on the field. Being able to draw out your full potential in a real match separates the strong from the weak.
【Shindou】
...I can't wait to see Ichinose-kun play a real match.
Shindou-san suddenly turns to face Satouin-san.
【Shindou】
I think we should get going.
【Satouin】
Huh? Whatever for? We came all this way, so we should go and see Ichinose-san--
Shindou-san smiles once more.
And it's at this point that Satouin-san realizes why he's asking to leave.
【Satouin】
...You're right, it is our duty to watch over her.
【Shindou】
I'm glad you understand.
Satouin-san looks up at the field like she wishes she could stay and help.
【Satouin】
...I do understand.
Then, she turns around to face me with a snap.
【Satouin】
......
She glares at me sharply.
【Masaya】
Wh-What is it?
After a while, she bows deeply.
【Satouin】
Allow me to ask you to take good care of Rika Ichinose one more time.
【Masaya】
Y-Yes, ma'am!
【Shindou】
Hahahaha, you're like a mom giving their daughter away for marriage, Satou-kun.
【Masaya】
Please don't joke about that stuff.
【Shindou】
Still, that's what it feels like for us.
Is he warning me not to do anything funny, or saying he trusts her in my hands?
Probably both to be honest.
【Masaya】
...I know. I'll take care of her.
That's a promise.
In fact, I'd already decided long ago to do just that.
Today's practice is over, but Rika and I have stayed behind to get some more work done.
Real matches are right in front of us, so we want to do everything we can to ensure we have no regrets.
I bellow into my headset.
【Masaya】
Up!
【Rika】
Yes!
【Masaya】
Down-right!
【Rika】
Yes!
【Masaya】
Accelerate!
【Rika】
Yes!
【Masaya】
PUT YOUR BACK INTO IT!
【Rika】
YES!
Rika flies according to my instructions as we repeat the drills over and over again.
It takes time for anyone to put oral instructions into practice.
Unfortunately, that's unavoidable because it takes time to process information after it reaches your ears.
For example, when I instruct Rika to move her arms, that information has to move from her ears to her brain, where it's then processed and moved along to her arms.
If we keep on practicing her moving as soon as she can after my order, we'll be able to tighten that window.
If we can add fast reaction times to Rika's already quick speed...
Then she'll become a pretty damn strong player.
If you can regain your form quickly, then there's nothing scary about a dogfight. If you can react quickly, then it becomes easier to give your opponent the slip.
If you can keep your cool no matter what an opponent tries against you in a dogfight, then you can use your speed to outdo them.
Just keep accelerating without worrying about what to do if you're stopped in your tracks.
That's the ideal form for a Speeder.
【Rika】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah...
【Masaya】
Okay, we'll stop here for today.
【Rika】
I can still continue!
【Masaya】
No. Overexerting yourself leads to injuries.
【Rika】
...You're right.
I pass Rika a drink as she descends and turns off her Grav Shoes.
【Rika】
Thank you very much.
【Masaya】
You were really great out there. I bet you can compete for a top spot at the tournament.
【Rika】
...You really mean that?
【Masaya】
I do. What, you don't believe in yourself? Don't you feel like you've improved?
【Rika】
I do, but... Um, well... being complimented by you is... quite embarrassing... Hehehe...
Rika lets out an adorable little giggle, but then suddenly stiffens up.
【Masaya】
...Rika?
【Rika】
......
I turn to see what she's looking at.
Arms, legs, torso, neck...
They form a grotesque silhouette that's hanging above in the sky.
【Kasumi】
......
Sweat starts to form on the palms of my clenched fists.
【Masaya】
Kasumi... Kurobuchi.
【Rika】
......
【Kasumi】
......
The corners of Kurobuchi's mouth start to curve up as she stares at Rika.
【Kasumi】
Heh heh...
She scorns her with her laugh, her presence.
【Masaya】
Why are you here?!
I call out to her, but she just continues to stare at Rika.
【Kasumi】
I thought I owed you an update.
【Masaya】
What kind of update?
【Rika】
......
Kurobuchi corrects her posture before she answers that question.
【Kasumi】
Thanks to my exemplary conduct, I, Kasumi Kurobuchi, have been granted permission to participate in the fall tournament! I couldn't have done it without you! Thank you, one and all!
【Rika】
......
She doesn't look at me once. Even though she was answering my question, she continued to stare solely at Rika.
【Kasumi】
You can knock people out with pincers, even fracture someone's wrist, but if you really, <i>really</i> insist it was all an accident, then, well... Heh heh! It doesn't matter at all! Hahaha, hahahahahaha!
【Rika】
That's great.
【Kasumi】
...It is?
Kurobuchi's long torso flops forward as she peers at Rika.
【Kasumi】
What's so great about that? Oh, do tell me, pretty please?
Her bloodshot eyes bore holes into Rika.
【Rika】
I'm glad you haven't been banned.
【Kasumi】
Heheh, heh heh heh heh heh!
【Rika】
......
【Kasumi】
Why? Why, just why? Why would you tell such a lie? You're scared, aren't you? So, so scared of little old me that you wanna run away? Anything to avoid having to play against me, right?
【Rika】
I want to face you, Kurobuchi-san.
【Kasumi】
Oh, do you now?
Kurobuchi seems to rotate her head in place. The dark aura around her intensifies.
【Kasumi】
You really want to face me?
Her behavior is extremely intimidating.
【Kasumi】
Someone like you will be overwhelmed, left in tatters. Hehe... I'll have you begging to be spared from ever playing FC again when I'm done. I'll prove just how superior I am.
【Rika】
I have no interest in that. I just play with and for the people from Takafuji, Kunahama, and even Kirishima Central.
【Kasumi】
With them? Hm? They're all gonna come play with you? Maybe save your sorry ass? Hehe... Heh heh heh!
Rika stands firm and puffs out her chest.
【Rika】
I have everyone inside my heart, no matter what. That's how we'll fight together, and it's something I'll never forget again. You can go ahead and play on your own, but I'll be with everyone else!
【Kasumi】
Ah...!
Kurobuchi seems to draw back a little.
Though she seems to be recoiling in shock that her tactics aren't working more than anything.
I see now.
Kurobuchi may excel at getting other people to follow her lead, but she doesn't know how to deal with people who won't play along.
I doubt most people can withstand her pressure, so I bet it rarely ever happens.
【Rika】
Ah...!
Rika glares at Kurobuchi.
【Kasumi】
You were so scared of me, Rika-chan, that you've forced yourself to get all tough? How adorable.
【Rika】
You're just as adorable, Kurobuchi-san.
【Kasumi】
Huh?
【Rika】
There's something that's been bothering me ever since you first appeared at Takafuji.
Rika ignores Kurobuchi's provocative words and approaches her.
【Masaya】
Hey, Rika...
【Kasumi】
What is it? Gonna test your luck by hitting me?
Kurobuchi tries to provoke Rika once again.
But Rika keeps on walking towards her.
【Kasumi】
Hey...!
When she gets within ten meters of her, Rika stops and leans in toward Kurobuchi's face.
What the hell is she up to?
This is kinda dangerous...
【Rika】
I knew it.
【Kasumi】
Huh?
【Masaya】
What?
I'm dumbfounded as Rika takes hold of Kurobuchi's hands.
【Rika】
Sacchan!
【Masaya】
H-HUH?!
She suddenly uses a weird nickname as she talks to Kurobuchi.
Wait, Sacchan? Isn't that...?
【Rika】
I had one more friend back in Kanoshima who was really important to me. A girl named Sacchan.
【Rika】
...She was the one who introduced FC to me in the first place.
Right, Rika <i>did</i> mention a friend she had back in Kanoshima who she'd been separated from years ago.
Is she saying that's Kasumi Kurobuchi?
I don't know how Kurobuchi was in the past, so maybe I don't have the right to judge, but she seems far from the image of the kind girl who taught Rika how to play FC.
【Kasumi】
Ah...!
However, Kurobuchi is evidently disturbed.
She hasn't denied it, so...
【Masaya】
The two of you are old friends, huh?
That's the only conclusion I can come to. As a famous detective once said, "Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth."
【Rika】
I told you, right? That we'd meet again in a tournament.
Rika <i>did</i> mention that she'd promised to meet her friend "Sacchan" in an FC tournament.
Which means that, in a strange way, they've fulfilled their promise.
【Rika】
...But I don't understand. Why do you play like you do, Sacchan?
【Kasumi】
......
Kurobuchi remains silent.
【Kasumi】
Ah...!
Kurobuchi seems to compose herself, eyebrows raising as she releases a sharp breath.
【Rika】
Ah...!
Then, she shakes free of Rika's hands.
【Kasumi】
Heh heh heh...
【Kasumi】
You'd remember <i>now?</i>
Kurobuchi smiles derisively, combing a hand through her dark hair.
【Rika】
That means you remember, Sacchan!
【Kasumi】
Me? Haha, don't be absurd. I have no need to remember.
【Rika】
Huh...?
【Kasumi】
I've never forgotten anything...
The smile finally fades from her face. The scorn and derision, gone from her expression. But in its place...
...is regret. Pain. Frustration.
【Kasumi】
Because the only reason I still play FC is to defeat you.
I've never seen Kurobuchi look like this.
【Rika】
No way...
【Kasumi】
Oh, is that a surprise? It makes total sense to me, personally. Maybe you'd understand if you tasted the despair of realizing the girl you trained to play FC is far more talented than you.
【Rika】
No, it can't be...
【Kasumi】
I've always been jealous of you.
【Masaya】
Ah...!
My chest starts to ache.
Kurobuchi... is traumatized like me...
【Rika】
But... you were always so good at FC, Sacchan. I've always wanted to be like you!
【Kasumi】
Please, don't make me laugh. Why would a girl who became a regular in her freshman year at Takafuji look up to me?
A frail smile appears on Kasumi's face.
【Rika】
Sacchan...
【Kasumi】
Don't call me that. It's a dumb nickname.
I imagine she has to force that thin smile to keep herself from exploding. That's what makes her scary.
Sadly, I know <i>exactly</i> how that feels.
Because I was same as her once.
【Kasumi】
Haha! Hahahahahahaha!
Kurobuchi's laughter isn't to threaten Rika this time. Instead, she's using it to protect herself.
And the sound alone makes my chest to throb with pain.
【Kasumi】
"Kacchan makes you sound like a boy, but Sacchan is cute, so let's go with that!" God, it's so damn childish. I get sick to my stomach just thinking about it.
Kurobuchi slams her palm against her chest.
【Kasumi】
My parents divorced, so I changed my name!
Then, she scowls at Rika.
【Kasumi】
The way I fight has changed too!
And finally, she leans in toward her.
【Kasumi】
How can you keep those pure, innocent memories when everything else has changed?!
【Rika】
......
Rika lowers her head.
【Kasumi】
If we happen to meet in the tournament, I'll do everything in my power to crush you.
【Rika】
......
【Kasumi】
Hehehe, haha, hahahahaha! I'm going to be ever so cruel to you. I'll destroy all those precious memories you hold so dear!
Kurobuchi's back to normal now.
For a moment, I hoped that Rika's memories would act as a key to help her.
But obviously, that didn't work out.
The corners of Kurobuchi's mouth once again turn upwards, forming a sneer.
【Kasumi】
Heh...!
And that sinister aura begins emanating at the exact same time.
This must be so painful for Rika.
【Masaya】
Rika...?
Or so I thought, but her expression is still firm.
【Rika】
You haven't changed.
And then...
【Rika】
You're still so cute, Sacchan. You haven't changed at all from back then!
【Kasumi】
You're still going on about that crap? Just give it a--
【Rika】
You're cute, Sacchan. I mean it! You're really, <i>really</i> cute!
【Kasumi】
Look, I--
【Rika】
YOU'RE ADORABLE!
【Kasumi】
Just sto--
【Rika】
Adorable, I say!
【Kasumi】
STOP IT!
Kurobuchi finally loses her cool.
【Kasumi】
Hehehe. Haha, hahahahaha! This is how you plan to turn the tables? How pathetic. That'll never work!
【Rika】
......
【Kasumi】
That's enough... I don't care what you're thinking, or what you intend to do. I only care about one thing.
【Rika】
......
【Kasumi】
I <i>will</i> crush you... I'll make it so you never wanna look at FC again.
Kurobuchi drags her feet along the ground as she backs away from us, only turning to walk away when she's built up a considerable distance.
【Masaya】
And there she goes...
I watch her back until she vanishes, just to make sure.
The way she walks makes it clear that she's ready to dodge an attack from behind at any moment.
And that makes me realize she lives in a state of constant tension and paranoia.
It hurts... Feels like I'm staring at myself in a way, even.
【Rika】
Haaah... Aaah!
Rika breathes a sigh, then suddenly staggers.
【Masaya】
Whoa, careful.
I rush to support her.
【Rika】
I suddenly feel all dizzy... Hahahahaha, Sacchan's really intense.
【Masaya】
The way you handled her was incredible.
【Rika】
Oh, you think so?
【Masaya】
Totally. Can't believe you drove her away by calling her cute.
【Rika】
Well, I was just being honest. She's just hiding how cute she is behind the way she acts and talks.
Rika clenches her fists.
【Rika】
That's why I need to remind Sacchan how fun FC can be.
【Masaya】
Right...
Rika looks up at me and smiles.
【Rika】
I'm confident now. I can face Sacchan in the sky, I know it.
【Masaya】
Not just her. You can play against anyone, Rika. Give this tournament all you've got.
【Rika】
I will!
Rika nods, and I feel a newfound sense of strength coming from her.
She might actually be able to put up a fight now. Against both Kasumi Kurobuchi... and herself.
The battle is drawing near. I gather my resolve as I await its arrival.
【Announcer】
The Nagasaki Preliminaries for the Fall Newcomer Flying Circus Tournament will now begin!
A voice from the speakers carries over the clear blue skies.
The day has finally arrived.
It's time to put everything we've trained for into action.
Asuka's eyes sparkle as she looks up and does a happy little jump.
【Asuka】
It's finally started, huh?
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Madoka】
Doesn't really feel like it's the right weather for a <i>fall</i> tournament, does it?
Madoka's right. It's so hot it might as well be summer still.
There are lines building outside the snow cone stands, and several booths have out of stock stickers over their drinks.
【Mashiro】
It would've been nice if all the trees had turned gold, at least...
【Misaki】
Makes you wonder why they're holding another tournameownt right after the summer one.
【Masaya】
They're not that close. We had the whole summer break to practice, which leaves a lot of time for people to grow.
【Misaki】
Good point. Rika-chan's gone from a little kitty to a big cat.
【Rika】
Huh? M-Me?
Rika's going to look at the tournament schedule with us before returning to the guys from Takafuji.
【Misaki】
You've come pretty far since the last tournament, y'know?
【Rika】
W-Well... only because Masaya-san's such a good second.
Everyone's agreed that I'll be Rika's second during her matches.
There are a lot of loopholes in the rules for FC seconds.
This might be a remnant from when not many schools participated, but a player's second can be from another school.
That may eventually change, but rules like that are scattered throughout FC.
Other loopholes like that may even be what help Kurobuchi skate by.
【Asuka】
You've gotten a lot stronger, Rika-chan!
【Masaya】
Yeah, you have.
【Mashiro】
They're right. You're going to become such a good player that I won't stand a chance against you. Not that I even stand much of chance now, really...
【Rika】
O-Oh no... But... I have been practicing really hard, so I do hope it pays off.
【Masaya】
Same. Well, don't worry, I'm sure you'll be able to show everyone how much you've grown. Of course, results are important too, but that still comes first.
【Asuka】
Right.
【Misaki】
Let's break a leg out there!
【Mashiro】
Yeah.
【Rika】
I will!
Hopefully not literally...
【Masaya】
(Now then...)
I decide to run through the players around me one more time.
Asuka's been away from practice for a while, so she's clearly at a disadvantage. Misaki's lack of practice is undeniable. Mashiro's barely even taken off her training wheels.
I'm sure everyone from Kunahama wants to give this their best shot, but I can only really rely on Rika at the moment.
【Madoka】
So, what do our brackets look like?
【Misaki】
Hope you end up playing Satouin-san again, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
I sure don't! I'd rather not play anyone who's actually good. Give me people who are like me!
Asuka hops forward and stares at the bracket.
【Mashiro】
Fine, let's take a look. Though, I have a really bad feeling about this...
【Asuka】
Oh, I found you, Mashiro-chan.
【Mashiro】
What?! Wh-Where?!
【Asuka】
Right here.
Asuka points right at Mashiro's name.
【Mashiro】
My opponent is... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
【Misaki】
Hahahahaha... This happens to you a lot, doesn't it? At least it's someone exactly like you! You got just what you wanted, huh?
【Mashiro】
Well, yeah, but I can already tell this is going to get ugly, and I hate it.
【Masaya】
Arika Okoze, huh?
That girl and Mashiro fight like cats and dogs.
【Masaya】
I know this'll be tough, but you've gotta do it.
【Mashiro】
I know that... Ugh, first I get Satouin-san in the summer tournament, and now this? I have the worst luck ever!
【Rika】
......
Rika's standing upright, staring at the bracket.
【Masaya】
Where are you, Rika?
【Rika】
I'm right next to Mashiro-chan.
【Mashiro】
Huh? Whoa! Y-You actually are! Great, I have to face someone else I know if I win the first round!
【Rika】
We don't know if I'll make it to the second round.
【Mashiro】
You'll <i>definitely</i> win! Ugh, why is my luck so bad?! The tournament gods must hate me!
【Misaki】
Personally, I think they're fond of you. Like, you're their personal plaything, y'know?
【Mashiro】
Well I don't want to be their plaything!
【Rika】
......
Rika participates in the conversation for a little bit before falling silent again.
【Masaya】
What's up?
【Rika】
Right next to my name... is Sacchan's.
Kasumi Kurobuchi.
【Masaya】
...Wow.
【Rika】
Is this fate?
In tournaments, for whatever reason, there always seem to be players you face every single time, and those you'll never face.
It might seem ridiculous, but because of that, some things that happen in tournaments feel like fate.
And this just happens to be one of them.
【Masaya】
I can't say, but it <i>is</i> reality.
【Rika】
I've trained for this. I've trained to fight Sacchan.
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Rika】
But now that I'm really going to play her, it feels strange.
Kurobuchi's intimidating figure flashes through my mind.
【Rika】
I'm... going to face her.
【Masaya】
If Kurobuchi gets far enough.
【Rika】
I'm sure Sacchan will win... I know it.
Rika mutters as if warning herself.
【Asuka】
As for me... Hm, is there anyone I know? Oh! I have to fight Inui-san in the third round.
【Masaya】
I see... I didn't really want any of us to face Inui again, to be honest.
Thanks to Asuka's injury, we didn't manage to make much progress with strategies to counter Inui.
【Asuka】
But I can learn so much from that match! I'm so excited!
【Misaki】
And as for me... Looks like I'll be up against Ganeko-san in the third round.
【Mashiro】
Ganeko-san, as in the girl Tanny calls big sis?
【Misaki】
Yep.
【Mashiro】
Us Kunahama sisters can't lose to them!
【Misaki】
I don't remember us ever being sisters, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Please try to!
【Misaki】
Not sure that's how it works...
【Madoka】
I've got a picture of the bracket on my phone.
【Masaya】
Great. Guess it's time to start warming up.
【Rika】
I'll be going back to my club for now... but I'll be back. Good luck, everyone!
【Asuka】
You too!
【Mashiro】
Same.
【Misaki】
Let's do this.
Before I have a chance to get annoyed by the lack of seriousness in Misaki's voice, fireworks go off to signal the start of the first match.
There's a muffled bang and a cloud of smoke.
Then, the audience bursts into cheers and applause.
【Rika】
The tournament's started.
【Masaya】
It sure has.
The fall tournament has finally begun.
The matches proceed amidst the bustling noise that's in no way inferior to that of the summer tournament. And it doesn't take long before all the first round matches are over.
【Arika】
Mashirooo!
【Mashiro】
......
【Arika】
Heh heh...! I won!
【Mashiro】
God, shut up already. You're making me all depressed!
【Arika】
Hey, Mashiro, can I ask you something?
【Mashiro】
...What?
【Arika】
So, it kinda slipped my mind, but who was it I beat in the first round again?
【Mashiro】
Urghhhhhhhhh! Me! It was me, okay! I lost! Now hurry back to your club!
【Arika】
I don't wanna!
【Mashiro】
Wh-Why not?
【Arika】
Cause I want to see the frustration on your face. It'll make my victory even more sweet!
【Mashiro】
You reaaally are a vile person!
I call out to Misaki, who's currently cooling down with Asuka to make sure their fatigue doesn't carry over to the next round.
【Masaya】
Shouldn't you say something to stop them?
【Misaki】
Why don't you speak up if they're bothering you?
【Masaya】
Just figured it would be easier if you got involved.
【Misaki】
No way. If I say something, their claws will get sharper.
Not sure how she arrived at that conclusion...
【Masaya】
But won't Mashiro get hurt at this rate?
【Misaki】
Don't worry, she'll be fine. Those two are just playing around. It'd be way weirder if Arika was being <i>nice</i> to Mashiro.
【Masaya】
You think...?
【Asuka】
You really believe in those two, huh Misaki-chan?
【Misaki】
Nah, that's not exactly right... Oh, hey, it's Rika-chan!
Rika comes trotting over us and gives Misaki a small bow.
【Rika】
Congratulations on passing the first round.
【Misaki】
You too.
【Asuka】
Congratulations. It was a great match.
【Rika】
Thank you... I thought I'd get to play against Mashiro-chan next, though...
Misaki and Rika made it through the first round, but Mashiro lost to Arika Okoze.
If Mashiro had won, she would have faced Rika next.
And now, if Rika can beat Okoze, the chances of her facing Kurobuchi in the third round are high.
【Rika】
Um, so that girl Mashiro-chan is talking to... She's the one who beat Mashiro-chan, right?
【Masaya】
Apparently they're old friends.
【Rika】
...They're friends?
I guess they don't look it with the way they're fighting.
【Asuka】
They're just showing how much they like each other, I'm sure of it.
【Misaki】
I dunno...
【Rika】
That girl... is my next opponent, huh?
【Mashiro】
Oh, Rika-san!
Mashiro, having noticed Rika's arrival, suddenly points at Okoze.
【Mashiro】
Please say something to this girl!
【Arika】
Hm? Who's that?
【Mashiro】
Your next opponent.
【Arika】
Huh?
Arika gives Rika a rude stare.
【Rika】
I-It's nice to meet you.
【Arika】
Hm...
【Mashiro】
Rika-san's from Takafuji, but she's been training with us at Kunahama, and she's super strong!
【Arika】
Oh, so she's a friend of yours, is she? Nice! I'm gonna crush her too! Like, if she's your friend, she's gotta be weak.
【Mashiro】
That's not true! Rika-san, please, you have to say something!
【Rika】
Oh, um, well... say what, exactly?
She turns to look at Misaki, searching for help.
【Misaki】
Hm... Maybe something like, "I'm gonna send you to the fiery pits of hell, baby"?
【Rika】
Are you sure?
【Asuka】
I think it sounds cool!
【Masaya】
...It does?
【Rika】
Um... O-Okay then... I'm gonna send you to the fiery pits of hell in the next match, baby. So, um, I'm looking forward to it.
【Arika】
...How am I supposed to respond?
【Mashiro】
She's asking you nicely, so just agree.
【Arika】
To be sent to the fiery pits of hell?
【Mashiro】
Sounds like the perfect place for you!
【Arika】
It is not! Gah, this is so lame.
Okoze points at Rika with a snap.
【Arika】
I'm gonna crush you in our match, just you wait!
【Rika】
Oh, yes. I'm looking forward to it. Let's make it a good match.
【Arika】
Ugh... Whatever! I'm leaving!
【Mashiro】
And don't come back!
【Arika】
I'll be back after I win!
Okoze storms off.
【Masaya】
You handled that well.
【Rika】
You really think I did a good job?
【Masaya】
In the past, you probably would have just gotten angry.
【Rika】
Probably, yes. I used to let everything get under my skin before... I was so bad at dealing with being provoked.
【Rika】
I think training at Kunahama has helped me develop into someone who can keep calm under pressure.
【Asuka】
I'm glad we helped.
【Misaki】
But y'know, maybe you just built up a tolerance 'cause we're all crazy. You ever thought about that?
【Masaya】
You've got a point there.
【Rika】
That's not it at all. Um, I uh... Um... I-I learned a lot!
【Misaki】
P-Pfft... Hehe!
【Asuka】
Hehe, hehehe...
【Mashiro】
Haha, hahahahaha!
Rika's confusion is so hilarious that everyone bursts out laughing.
【Rika】
D-Did I say something strange?
【Masaya】
Not at all... Make sure you win the next match.
【Rika】
I will!
Rika uses her whole body to give me a giant nod.
【Masaya】
Mashiro lost to Okoze in a match of speed. She still has the habits she picked up as a Fighter, so there were a lot of wasted movements that spelled doom for her.
She changed styles halfway through the season and hasn't gotten a chance to fully adapt.
When she could keep up with Okoze, she kept up. When she couldn't keep up, she didn't. All things considered, maybe this outcome's a good thing.
It feels like Mashiro's almost ready to break out of her shell. She just needs that one final push...
【Rika】
What should I do, then?
【Masaya】
Today, you're using All-Rounder Grav Shoes that are tuned toward Speeder settings.
I'm working under the hypothesis that she's going to get involved in a fair amount of dogfights.
I chose these settings so that, if she does end up facing Kurobuchi, and she does need to make split second decisions, she can.
【Masaya】
If you can challenge your opponent to a contest of speed, you should, but your main goal is to get in front of them and engage in a dogfight.
【Rika】
Right.
【Masaya】
Okoze will probably try to challenge you to a race of speed, but if you can stop her, everything will go in your favor.
【Rika】
...But if I don't, everything will go against me, right?
【Masaya】
No.
【Rika】
How come?
【Masaya】
The settings on your Grav Shoes will make you slower than Okoze, but you're an experienced Speeder. If you throw in some shortcuts, you can take the lead in a contest of speed.
It'll be Speeder versus Speeder, but it won't end like the match between Prez and Inui during the summer tournament.
【Masaya】
I think you'll either barely scrape by, or completely dominate this match, Rika.
【Rika】
...I'll do my best!
【Masaya】
That's the spirit! Now, go out there and give her hell!
【Rika】
Yessir!
The match heats up on the third line.
【Masaya】
That's it! Keep it up, and think up ways to stop Okoze!
【Rika】
Understood!
【Arika】
Urgh! I'm not done yet! I've gotta win this! Big Sis is counting on me!
The first point was scored by Okoze when she touched second.
Rika started a dogfight on the second line, allowing her to rack up two points. Then, Okoze proceeded to touch third.
After that, Rika continued to score two more points on the third line, making the score 4:2 in her favor.
Okoze's trying to shake Rika and go for the buoys, while Rika's attempting to push down on Okoze's head. That's the way the match is running.
【Arika】
Shit! You're a Speeder, so cut it out already! Just race me, coward!
【Rika】
I'll do what it takes to win!
That's it.
She's not rising to Okoze's provocations.
The old Rika probably would have flown into a fit of rage by now.
I glance over at Okoze's second.
【Mayu】
......
Looks like she's considering her instructions carefully.
This is the deciding moment.
Okoze's gotten used to Rika's playstyle. If she can slip past Rika, she might get the next few buoys.
So, before the other second makes her decision...
【Arika】
Ngh...
The moment Okoze pulls away from Rika to build up speed...
【Masaya】
Rika, go for the buoy!
【Rika】
Okay!
【Arika】
Huuuh?! W-Wait!
Okoze is slow to react and gets left behind.
【Rika】
Got it!
Rika successfully touches the buoy.
Now it's 5:2.
This match is ours.
Rika has control of the game, and she has momentum.
【Arika】
SHIT!
【Rika】
Ah...!
Rika's face...
She's not being negligent, she's not straining herself. It's a perfect, diligent expression for a girl like her...
But it's also the face of someone enjoying a match.
【Rika】
......
If she feels that way, then everything will turn out fine.
【Rika】
Haaah...
【Arika】
Urghhh!
Rika breathes a sigh of relief as Okoze groans in frustration.
Everything went according to plan.
Rika won the match, 8:3.
【Masaya】
Good job.
【Rika】
I won-- Whoa?!
【Arika】
I won't lose next time!
Okoze suddenly appears from behind Rika.
【Arika】
I won't! I won't, I won't, I <i>won't</i> lose next time we play!
【Rika】
R-Right. I'll do my best not to lose either.
【Arika】
No! I'm gonna win! Whoa!
Okoze abruptly goes flying to the side.
【Rika】
Huh?!
【Mayu】
You're such a naughty girl, Arika.
【Mayu】
I do apologize for the trouble my little sister has caused. I'll deal with her punishment, so I do hope you can find it in your heart to forgive her.
【Arika】
P-Punishment? Please, anything but that, Big Sis!
【Mayu】
You get what you deserve!
【Arika】
You're such a sadiiiiiist!
【Mayu】
Now, if you'll excuse us... Let's go, Arika.
【Arika】
Y-Yes, ma'aaaaaam...
And just like that, Ganeko-san comes and takes Okoze away.
【Rika】
Th-That sure was something.
【Masaya】
You can say that again.
There are all types of people, I guess.
【Masaya】
Now then, next up is--
【Rika】
Sacchan, right?
【Masaya】
Probably...
Kurobuchi's match is next.
I wonder how she intends to play it?
I'm sure something in her past made her this way. I even got a glimpse of that during her conversation with Rika yesterday, but...
Thinking about how Kurobuchi uses negative emotions to get at people sickens me.
【Masaya】
Kurobuchi made it through, just like we thought.
【Rika】
...Yes.
She didn't do anything that could result in a disqualification.
The worst she's done all tournament is touch her opponent on the first line in her first match, which was taken as a rule violation and cost her one point.
【Rika】
She hasn't done anything particularly suspicious yet, but...
【Masaya】
We can't say she hasn't done anything at all. Her floats still bother me.
They always seem to be in positions that benefit Kurobuchi.
It's enough to raise suspicion, but not enough to investigate.
It's likely she's controlling her floats.
But that's not the reason Kurobuchi's winning.
Her peculiar, overwhelming presence is her main weapon. And perhaps her peculiar worldview is too...
Anyone who gets caught up in that loses.
They practically self-destruct.
【Rika】
Why do you think she hasn't done anything dirty yet?
【Masaya】
She's probably saving it for you.
【Rika】
You think so...?
【Masaya】
If there's someone you <i>really</i> want to beat, then you don't want to show them your trump card, right?
【Rika】
That would make it harder for you to win.
【Masaya】
Exactly. Kurobuchi's not doing anything special here.
【Rika】
...Haha! Haaah, haaah!
Rika lets out a little laugh, then pants strangely.
【Masaya】
What's up?
【Rika】
I know this is exactly what Sacchan wants, but I'm a little... scared.
【Masaya】
I'm not surprised. That's what she's best at.
【Rika】
I should try to enjoy everything about my match with Sacchan.
Rika looks at the ground for a moment...
【Rika】
Including that fear. Everything.
【Masaya】
If you really feel that way, you'll be fine.
【Rika】
I hope I do...
Rika's trembling slightly.
【Masaya】
Rika...
【Rika】
I'm sorry, I'll stop now.
She says that, but the trembling doesn't stop.
I have to say something to motivate her.
But as I'm searching for the right words...
【Satouin】
Why are you acting the part of a coward?!
Satouin-san suddenly appears by our sides.
【Rika】
S-Satouin-senpai?
【Masaya】
H-How long have you been there?
【Satouin】
That isn't what's important right now!
【Satouin】
Neither is whether you're afraid or not!
【Rika】
I-It isn't?
【Satouin】
It is somewhat, but it also isn't.
Satouin-san speaks in a forceful tone. This isn't like her.
【Satouin】
Listen here, I do not care for Kasumi Kurobuchi one bit. That is why I want you to crush her.
【Rika】
C-Crush her?
【Satouin】
I also know precisely how you should crush her. The most preferable method being giving her a concussion.
【Masaya】
B-But...
That's extreme.
【Satouin】
However, that is not the kind of revenge I desire.
But you just said giving her a concussion was the most preferable method. Weren't you talking about your preference?
【Rika】
Then, what should I do?
Satouin-san takes a deep breath.
【Satouin】
Why do you think people cheat? Actually, let's turn that question on its head. For what purpose do we have rules?
【Rika】
Rules...? Well, they're to ensure a fair competition, aren't they?
If you could use your hands in soccer, then it wouldn't be soccer. If a baseball batter could run to any base he wanted after hitting the ball, then it wouldn't be baseball.
Rules are what form sports, what keeps them fair. Rika's viewpoint isn't wrong.
【Satouin】
That is the conclusion, not the purpose.
Oh, right...
【Satouin】
Rules exist so that we may have fun competing!
【Masaya】
...They do?
【Satouin】
Things that stop competition from being fun, like foul play, are prohibited.
【Rika】
...Because they're not fun.
【Satouin】
Teach Kasumi Kurobuchi the fun of FC.
【Rika】
O-Okay!
【Satouin】
Make her realize that playing without cheating is enjoyable.
Good grief. I give up.
Satouin-san just came in and stole my thunder.
【Rika】
Understood!
【Satouin】
That's the spirit.
Satouin-san flashes a fearless smile.
【Satouin】
And in the event that you succeed... Oh, I know.
Satouin-san's hair suddenly flutters behind her in the breeze.
【Satouin】
I shall bequeath my "in" to you. From tomorrow onward, you shall be known as Ichinosein!
【Masaya/Rika】
Ichinosein?!
【Masaya】
Ichinosein?!
【Rika】
Ichinosein?!
【Satouin】
And I shall simply be Satou... But it is the way things should be.
【Masaya】
Only one person can have it at a time...?
Is it supposed to be like some sort of championship belt?
【Satouin】
Ichinosein... It sounds quite good. Not quite as good as Satouin, but...
【Rika】
I-I don't think that's a good idea.
【Satouin】
Oh? Please, don't decline on my account.
【Rika】
I doubt I could handle the responsibility that comes with the "in" as well as you can, Satouin-san.
【Satouin】
I see. Too bad... I'm looking forward to the match. Do your best.
【Satouin】
Go out there and enjoy it, Rika!
【Rika】
Huh?
【Satouin】
Is something wrong? Why are you so surprised?
Satouin-san just used Rika's first name.
【Rika】
D-Do you think you could repeat that last thing you said one more time?
Satouin-san snorts.
【Satouin】
Once you return happy, I shall say it again.
【Rika】
Oh... Okay!
【Satouin】
Masaya Hinata, I'm counting on you to support Ichinose-san.
【Masaya】
I'll give it everything I've got.
【Satouin】
...Very good.
Satouin-san gives us a powerful smile before leaving.
And we watch her walk out of sight.
【Rika】
I feel like I've got my courage back.
【Masaya】
Good.
Rika won't be playing this match to enjoy it. Instead, her main goal is  to teach Kurobuchi how fun FC can be.
Maybe that's the exact kind of motivation she needs to resist all of Kurobuchi's negativity.
【Rika】
I'm going to do my best.
【Masaya】
I know.
It's finally time.
Rika and I go through our final checks.
【Masaya】
There's nothing more I can say. You just need to strut your stuff.
【Rika】
Right.
【Masaya】
Kurobuchi will try and drag you into her own little world.
【Rika】
And I have to stay in mine... right?
【Masaya】
Bingo.
I look up toward first.
Kurobuchi's already hovering around it.
【Rika】
She's looking at us.
【Masaya】
She sure is.
【Kasumi】
......
Kurobuchi stares down at us.
Her mouth is curved into a sinister smile, the corners of her lips raised far higher than a normal person's.
However, despite the smile, there's no hint of joy in the eyes as they peer through her long, dark hair.
I imagine this is what a beast looks like once it finds its prey.
But this lacks an animalistic simplicity. It look far more ominous.
It's more like a witch who's found an unfortunate victim to throw into her cauldron.
If you get drawn in, if you fall behind, you'll be swallowed whole by her overwhelming intensity.
It won't matter if you're stronger than her, you'll have the tables turned on you all the same.
【Rika】
......
【Masaya】
Remember what Asuka taught you in practice, and what Satouin-san said to you earlier.
【Rika】
I will!
【Masaya】
You can do this, Rika. Now, get out there and show her your FC... No, <i>our</i> FC!
【Rika】
Okay!
Rika flies off toward first.
【Rika】
Good to see you again.
【Kasumi】
Good to see you too.
I can hear their conversation through Rika's mic.
【Kasumi】
Um, so...
【Rika】
What is it?
【Kasumi】
What was your name again?
She goes in with a cliched line to try and get under Rika's skin.
【Rika】
I'm Rika Ichinose. I'm glad we get to have this match.
【Kasumi】
Ohhh, right. Heh! Hehehehe... I'm surprised you came here. I mean... you know horrible things are going to happen to you... Hehe! Hahaha! Hahahahaha!
Kurobuchi laughs as she stretches out her neck, then leans in toward Rika.
【Kasumi】
Con-cus-sion.
【Referee】
Please refrain from unnecessary chatter.
【Kasumi】
......
Kurobuchi's upper body spins, seemingly disconnected from her spine, to face the referee.
【Referee】
Wh-What?
【Kasumi】
Nooothing.
And then, with another unnatural spin, she's facing Rika again.
【Kasumi】
You can always forfeit. Are you scared? You <i>are</i> scared, aren't you? Why not just run away? It's a great idea. Just ruuuuuun awaaaaaay.
【Rika】
I'm scared, but I'm going to have fun.
【Kasumi】
Is there <i>really</i> any point in trying to act tough here? Why not just run away before you get hurt? It'll be so much easier. Don't you think? Well?
【Rika】
I'm going to enjoy this match, so you should enjoy it with me, Sacchan!
【Kasumi】
Who's Sacchan? Is that the ref's name?
【Rika】
That's enough about names. Let's have a fun FC match.
【Kasumi】
Hehehe, fine. You know, I hear the moment you get concussed, haha, hahahaha... is so much fun that all your memories just float away.
【Rika】
Is that so?
【Referee】
Enough chatter! We're starting the match!
Kurobuchi once again swivels to face the referee.
【Kasumi】
I'm ready whenever.
【Rika】
Do you think I can check her floats before the match begins?
【Kasumi】
Ah...!
Kurobuchi remains silent as she waves her floats around.
And by doing so, she makes the special substance she's smeared over her floats vanish.
She's given up on being able to use her floats to her advantage in exchange for not being disqualified before the match even starts.
【Kasumi】
Heh!
Kurobuchi leans forward sharply, glaring at Rika with bloodshot eyes.
【Kasumi】
You worry about the weirdest things.
【Rika】
One must be fully prepared in order to have fun. I'd also like to check the left float as well, please.
【Kasumi】
Hehe!
Kurobuchi displays a mouth-splitting grin as she continues to glare at Rika and swings her left float forward.
Rika checks it, then turns back to the referee.
【Rika】
Sorry about that. Everything's fine.
【Referee】
R-Right. Good to know.
The referee is clearly confused by the way the two of them are acting, but continues anyway.
【Referee】
Ready, set... go!
【Kasumi】
......
【Rika】
......
They start by going into Low Yo-Yos at the exact same time.
How will Kurobuchi tackle this first test of speed?
Both players are using Speeder tuned shoes.
Kurobuchi is wearing Caduceuses by Invade, the president's favorite brand.
They take a little more getting used to than your typical Japanese brand, but once you're accustomed to them, there's a lot extra you can do with them.
Rika is using Maine Coons from Small Grove, a brand that's about as standard as they come.
Only hers are All-Rounders by nature, tuned to be more like Speeder shoes.
From what I gathered during the last two matches, I think Kurobuchi is using similar settings.
That means she wants the match to primarily focus on speed, but also needs the ability to make more intricate movements when necessary.
How will things play out from here?
【Rika】
Ah...!
【Kasumi】
Ah...!
For now, their speed is about equal.
However, they're currently speeding downwards in a Low Yo-Yo. Whoever can pull off the smoothest ascent is the one who'll reach second early.
【Kasumi】
Ngh!
Hm?
Kurobuchi sways slightly as she pulls up into an ascent, perhaps rocked by the sea breeze.
Thanks to that, Rika's upper body is ahead of her.
Was that an actual mistake, or is she trying to trick us?
【Masaya】
Be careful. Who knows what Kurobuchi's plotting right now...
【Rika】
Okay!
It'll only take a moment for her to pull any dirty tricks. By the time I notice, it'll be too late for me to help her.
【Rika】
Ah...!
Rika keeps her lead as she approaches second.
【Kasumi】
Ah...!
The distance between them isn't great.
Kurobuchi can reach Rika if she stretches herself out.
If this wasn't the start of the match, I'd order Rika to make a bigger gap.
If Kurobuchi breaks the rules and touches Rika now, Rika will be given a point for the violation, and Kurobuchi would be forced to jump to the second line.
Rika would then touch the buoy, giving her two points total.
Playing dirty to control her opponents might be what Kurobuchi does best, but even she won't want to give herself a two point handicap right off the bat.
So then, what's she gonna do?
I stare up at her.
【Rika】
I'm going to touch the buoy.
【Masaya】
Okay... Huh?
【Kasumi】
......
D-Dammit!
There's a smile plastered on Kurobuchi's face, one she seemingly can't hold back.
【Kasumi】
Heh!
She raises her upper body, dropping her speed.
My heart shudders inside my chest.
【Masaya】
Flying Squirrel! Watch out!
Naming techniques makes it easier to communicate over the radio, which is why I came up with that.
It's the same technique she used to hurt Asuka, spreading out all her limbs to squish her up against the buoy.
【Rika】
I'm okay!
Rika twists her body horizontally as she uses her shoulder to throw her entire arm forward.
Using your shoulder lets you reach further than you would normally, but it also ruins your form. This means you only save it for the last possible moment, and rarely use it outside of going for a buoy.
Especially on the first line, where it completely kills your speed. Normally, using it is unthinkable.
【Rika】
Got it!
Rika uses the recoil from second to accelerate while straining her upper body to bend backward like a shrimp.
【Kasumi】
Huh?!
Rika's back collides with Kurobuchi's chest.
【Rika】
Ah...!
【Kasumi】
Ngh!
The recoil from that sends Kurobuchi backward, and Rika down the second line.
【Rika】
I got the first point!
【Masaya】
Good work, Rika!
Breaking through the Flying Squirrel isn't all that hard.
The Flying Squirrel is a technique designed to seal the shock from a collision inside a membrane, rather than allowing it to spread out.
To do so, you have to wedge your opponent between yourself and a buoy at the perfect time.
If your opponent is fully focused on the buoy, you can pull it off, which means it's more effective if your opponent doesn't know about it.
But both Rika and I witnessed Kurobuchi using that move on Asuka.
Why wouldn't we come up with a countermeasure?
All we need to do to avoid it is bump into Kurobuchi and mess up her timing.
Though Rika may have just touched Kurobuchi, she did so after touching second. And that means the match is considered to have moved past the first line.
【Kasumi】
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
Kurobuchi's eyes widen behind her long black hair.
【Kasumi】
Nghhhhhhhhh!
Huh?
【Masaya】
Kurobuchi's jumping to the third line instead of the second.
【Rika】
The third line? Does that mean she wants to challenge me to a dogfight there?
【Masaya】
Probably.
Kurobuchi can't catch Rika on the second line. And even if she did, they're both Speeders. It won't end up in a dogfight, but a scramble from buoy to buoy.
I assume she's come to the same conclusion.
That's why she's waiting on the third line, ready to challenge Rika to a dogfight.
Why is she so fixated on them despite being a Speeder, you ask?
Because the frantic movements allow her to pull off the pincer, like she did with the Takafuji students.
【Rika】
This is my second point.
【Kasumi】
Ah...!
The moment Rika touches the third, Kurobuchi ascends on the third line.
Then, she shoots off like a rocket in Rika's direction.
It's the Suicida. This technique is supposed to drive an opponent toward the water.
【Masaya】
Dodge it!
【Rika】
Okay!
There's no need for us to play along.
【Kasumi】
I won't let you escape... I'll drag you down with me!
Kurobuchi falls fast, chasing after Rika as she attempts to escape.
Holy shit...
This Suicida is perfect, and she even managed to change direction... I had a feeling before, but now I'm convinced.
Kurobuchi really is...
【Masaya】
There's no point running! Slow your speed and pin her down!
【Rika】
Okay!
Kurobuchi comes hurtling into Rika from above. The anti-gravitons from Rika's shoes send water flying in all directions.
【Rika】
Nghhhhhh!
I can hear the sound of gritting teeth through my headset.
【Masaya】
Rika!
【Rika】
I'm fine! Don't worry, I practiced this over and over with Mashiro-chan and Asuka-san! I can handle it!
Rika seems to spring off the water's surface as she nimbly fixes her form, then starts flying parallel to it.
【Masaya】
Kurobuchi is above you and to the right.
【Rika】
Okay!
In theory, what Rika wants to do is fly in the opposite direction to gain some distance. However, Rika is below Kurobuchi, and Kurobuchi is moving right toward her.
This is a scramble for control. Trying to get away will give Kurobuchi the idea that we're afraid of her. We'd turn over control of the match.
And so...
Rika flies toward Kurobuchi, the gap between them rapidly closing.
【Rika】
I'll show you I'm not afraid, Sacchan! I'll show you how fun this can be!
Rika charges headfirst.
【Kasumi】
Heh... You're actually flying to me? What a fool... Graaah!
A grating sound echoes out from Kurobuchi's mouth as she flies toward Rika.
【Rika】
Ngh!
【Kasumi】
Ngh!
There's an audible crash as the two collide.
Seeing Rika trying to get behind her, Kurobuchi charges forward to block her path.
It's coming...
【Masaya】
......
But if I say something now, I might just get in Rika's way.
【Rika】
Ah...!
What am I saying? There's no need for me to interfere. Rika knows this far better than me. She's learned through experience.
【Kasumi】
Got you!
Kurobuchi's wide eyes are bloodshot, almost as if they're casting a red light themselves.
Here it comes. Come on, do it!
【Kasumi】
......
Kasumi leans so far forward that it's like she's entrusting her body to the wind.
Almost makes you wanna reach out and catch her.
【Rika】
Huh...?!
【Kasumi】
It's over!
A long serpent suddenly extends to each side of Rika's head.
Those are Kurobuchi's arms, stretched out to surround Rika.
It's a pincer, a dirty trick designed to make your opponent faint.
【Rika】
No way!
【Kasumi】
Ngh!
Rika nimbly lurches forward, pressing her own face against Kurobuchi's right arm.
That alone makes Kurobuchi's plan crumble.
【Rika】
Ah...!
The two of them are shot off balance at the exact same moment.
【Kasumi】
Curse you!
Kurobuchi's long legs cut through the air as she stretches them toward Rika, still trying to reach her.
【Rika】
Not happening!
Rika reaches out an arm and touches Kasumi's right leg.
【Kasumi】
D-Dammit!
Kurobuchi keeps on reaching out, but Rika repels limb after limb.
【Rika】
I told you, it's not happening!
Breaking through a pincer is simple.
When you're touched on two sides of the membrane at once, the shock has nowhere to go, so it concentrates in the middle.
But you can avoid that outcome by touching your opponent first.
If both arms are stretched out toward you, just touch the right arm. That alone is enough to turn things back to normal.
【Kasumi】
Ngh!
Really, the referee should have called foul play for Kurobuchi's attacks, but Rika's defense is so perfect that he hasn't had the chance.
【Rika】
It's not happening. Don't make me keep repeating myself!
Or wait, maybe he can't even tell that she's playing dirty because of how well Rika's doing?
【Kasumi】
Nghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Heh, hehehe!
Kasumi backs off slowly.
【Rika】
Huh?
The path to fourth opens up, as if Kurobuchi's recognized her loss.
What does she have up her sleeve?
【Kasumi】
......
She just keeps falling back in silence.
Why would she abandon the path toward the next buoy when she's a Speeder?
I doubt she's planning on throwing the match, so...
【Rika】
This must be bait.
【Masaya】
Agreed. It's too obvious. Should we challenge her to a dogfight instead?
【Rika】
No...
Rika's voice resounds.
【Rika】
I want to play along.
【Masaya】
Why?
【Rika】
Because I want to know everything about Sacchan! Like why she's so obsessed with playing dirty.
【Rika】
I think I'm the only one who can figure it all out.
【Rika】
Because I'm probably the only one who's practiced just to face her...
【Masaya】
...You're right.
Out of all the participants in this tournament, only Rika's trained specifically to fight Kurobuchi.
【Rika】
I'll discover everything, then maybe I'll come to an understanding, or at least comprehend it... I think I'm the only one who can do it, so I... want to.
【Masaya】
Okay. If you really insist, I've got no reason to stop you.
【Rika】
...Thank you very much. Here I go!
Rika starts flying toward fourth.
【Kasumi】
Ah...!
Kurobuchi is hot on her tail.
Isn't this the story of the first line all over again?
Is she gonna go for the Flying Squirrel a second time?
Her attempts at a pincer failed over and over, but maybe she's decided the Flying Squirrel is a safer bet.
【Kasumi】
......
Or maybe she's just trying to confirm it's useless.
Sometimes, when your back is against the wall and all your techniques have been rendered useless, you just want to make sure. You know there's no point, but you repeat the same move to find out if there's really no point.
But does that make any sense? Is Kurobuchi really a person who'd give in to her emotions like that?
【Masaya】
I realize you want to find out everything about Kurobuchi, but don't let your guard down.
【Rika】
I swear I won't! My skin is tingling right now!
【Masaya】
It's what?
【Rika】
Tingling! I'm concentrating so hard that I can feel the vibrations of the air. I feel like I know exactly where Sacchan is without even having to turn around to see her.
【Masaya】
I see... That <i>does</i> happen sometimes, yeah.
Anyone can heighten their senses by concentrating.
But that doesn't normally result in your skin tingling.
That only happens if you concentrate as hard as you can for an extended period of time.
Only when you have a complete read on positions, the time, your opponent, the situation... do you experience tingling on your skin.
【Rika】
I can feel it in my body, so I can't let my guard down even if I want to!
【Masaya】
Got it. Still, be careful.
【Rika】
I will!
Rika speeds up as she heads toward fourth.
Kurobuchi chases after her, not far behind.
Is she really going to try the Flying Squirrel?
【Rika】
Ah...!
The moment Rika goes to touch fourth...
【Kasumi】
Please wait one moment, Ichinose-san.
A sweet, lovely voice rings out behind her.
【Rika】
I won't let my guard down.
【Kasumi】
No, you've got it all wrong...
Asuka did this exact same thing. She's gonna talk to Rika as she approaches to smother her!
【Rika】
Take this!
Rika bends back like a prawn, twisting her hips and reaching out a hand in an attempt to thrust Kurobuchi away.
【Masaya】
Huh?
A cold shiver runs up my spine.
【Kasumi】
I love you, Ichinose-san.
Kurobuchi's hands shoot out to each of Rika's ears.
She was feigning a Flying Squirrel to use a pincer?!
Straight from one dirty trick to another!
I can't believe this was her plan all along!
【Masaya】
Rika!
【Rika】
Ah...!
Rika's hand moves too late, and they both get sent flying in opposite directions.
【Masaya】
Rika! Rika! RIKA! Are you okay?! Are you still conscious?!
【Rika】
I'm fine!
Rika replies, sounding in perfect health.
【Rika】
First, I need to touch fourth.
She succeeds, making the score 3:0.
【Masaya】
What the hell just happened?
【Rika】
I used the side of my head to hit Sacchan's hand. As long as one side connects before the other, the pincer won't work.
She forced Kurobuchi's right hand into her head to get away?
【Masaya】
That's pretty dangerous.
【Rika】
It is?
In her heightened state of concentration, she probably feels like she'll be fine no matter how dangerous the plan, so long as she doesn't mess up.
Once the match is over and she's had time to calm down, she'll realize how bad it really is.
【Kasumi】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah...
Kurobuchi floats there, exhausted and panting for breath.
【Rika】
Sacchan! I won't let you get me with any of your tricks, so stop this already!
【Kasumi】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah...
【Rika】
Why don't we have a fun match?
【Kasumi】
...A <i>fun</i> match?
【Rika】
A match where we give it our all! Playing dirty just gets in the way of that, which is why it's against the rules! So let's do this! Let's have a proper match!
【Kasumi】
D-Don't screw with me! It's too late... I...! I...! I...!
【Rika】
......
【Kasumi】
Why do you think I resorted to this stuff in the first place?! Because I can't win! I could never beat you by playing fair!
【Rika】
That makes me happy!
【Kasumi】
...What's that supposed to mean?!
【Rika】
I'm happy that you think I'm so strong! But you're wrong. It was never about winning or losing in the beginning.
【Rika】
We played because it was fun! Because we wanted to have fun matches! You know I'm right!
【Kasumi】
You're so naive! I play dirty because I wanna win!
Kurobuchi charges head first, seemingly attempting a Suicida.
【Rika】
Sacchan!
【Kasumi】
Quit screwing with me!
【Rika】
Huh?!
Right before Kurobuchi reaches Rika, she pulls her torso up, breaking hard. Her hips project out, her head flung back.
【Masaya】
Watch out!
Now slanted backward, she thrusts her legs forward.
【Kasumi】
Die!
Her legs are about to wrap around Rika!
【Rika】
Sorry, not happening!
Rika uses both hands to strike away Kurobuchi's right leg.
【Kasumi】
Ngh!
【Rika】
Ugh!
The two of them are separated by the recoil.
【Rika】
I practiced so I could say this to you. I practiced so I could make you understand.
【Kasumi】
...Huh?
【Rika】
Together... Let's give it our all and fly!
【Kasumi】
I-I told you to quit screwing with me!
【Rika】
I'm not! If you don't do that... I'll get angry!
【Kasumi】
Huh?
【Rika】
I'LL GET ANGRY!
【Kasumi】
So you're saying I'm not already giving it my best shot?!
【Rika】
You're not! You just don't get it, Sacchan!
I imagine Kurobuchi has won most of her matches by being hostile and controlling the flow of the game.
But Rika's anger is something Kurobuchi can't control. It's a different breed, and I think she's aware of that.
【Kasumi】
......
Kurobuchi seems flustered.
【Rika】
Let's play a proper FC match together! We're wasting time here!
【Kasumi】
Th-This is <i>my</i> FC!
【Rika】
Then that's totally fine! Let's just play our match! I practiced so hard for this to fly with you, Sacchan!
【Kasumi】
Fly with... me?
In a moment, Kurobuchi's expression stiffens.
She not angry or annoyed. If anything, she's bewildered.
However...
【Kasumi】
Heh... Heh heh heh heh...!
She quickly forces out an ominous laugh.
【Kasumi】
I'm gonna... make you regret this!
【Rika】
Please do.
An exhausted Kurobuchi musters up what remains of her strength.
【Kasumi】
I...! I can still do this!
【Rika】
Please do!
【Masaya】
Rika, be careful. I'm sure Kurobuchi's got something up her sleeve. She's just like Asuka.
【Masaya】
She can sense the movements of the membrane. That's how she managed to concuss three people in a row.
Airkick Turns and Cobras are techniques that require you to control the direction of force from your membrane.
But for Kurobuchi, it doesn't end there. She must also have the ability to sense the direction of force in other people's membranes to some extent.
【Rika】
I'll be fine. I'm not afraid of her now.
【Kasumi】
R-Raaaaaaaaah! Ah! Ah! Aaaaaaaaah!
Kurobuchi roars as she flies toward Rika.
【Rika】
I'll play this match and find out everything about Sacchan!
【Kasumi】
Argh, ah! Ah! Ah! Aaaaaahhh!
Rika gets into a dogfighting stance, ready to intercept Kurobuchi's charge.
【Rika】
Huh?
【Kasumi】
Ngh!
Kurobuchi seems to disregard the laws of physics as she suddenly moves off to the side in front of Rika.
I knew it, she can use Airkick Turns.
【Kasumi】
Ah...!
Rika deftly avoids Kurobuchi's attempt to get behind her by rising quickly.
【Rika】
I know that move from practicing with Asuka-san! I can do a whole lot more than this!
She makes the most of her speed, doing a full revolution in the air before shooting toward Kurobuchi's back.
【Kasumi】
Ngh!
Kurobuchi desperately tries to escape.
【Rika】
See, you can fly <i>really</i> well, Sacchan! Why play dirty?!
【Kasumi】
These... These beautiful techniques will never work! Never! I have to be unique... or I won't make it! I have to play dirty, I just have to...
【Rika】
Ah!
Holy shit!
Kurobuchi's hands just shot out at unimaginable speeds in a completely unexpected attack.
She didn't concuss Rika with that, did she?!
【Masaya】
Rika!
【Rika】
I'm fine, she only grazed me!
【Masaya】
A graze is all it takes!
【Rika】
I'm fine! Just a little more! Please let me continue this match!
There's nothing else I can say, huh?
In fact, there's nothing anyone can say. Rika intends to get her feelings through to Kurobuchi no matter the cost.
【Kasumi】
I have to play dirty, I have to... or I won't make it!
【Rika】
I think anyone can make it if they try!
【Kasumi】
I...! I...! I...!
I can feel her irritation. She has something she wants to say, but she can't form the words.
【Rika】
Now's the time for playing, not talking, so let's play!
【Kasumi】
......
【Rika】
I'm sure you'll find your answer here! If this is how your version of FC is, that's fine. But I don't want to let such a fun match end in foul play!
【Rika】
Not when it's gotten this good! It's too soon for it to end!
【Kasumi】
Urgh, ah, haaah, haaah. Urghhhhhh!
Rika nimbly dodges Kurobuchi's charge.
【Kasumi】
I, haaah, haaah, haaah... Mmm! I... I want to... have fun!
【Rika】
Great!
And so, the match continues.
【Kasumi】
Let's go!
Kurobuchi charges straight forward. Only this time, she's not acting strangely in the slightest.
【Rika】
Yeah!
Rika takes a deep breath as she dodges the charge.
【Kasumi】
You're wide open!
Kurobuchi bends into a turn and goes for Rika's back.
【Rika】
Not today!
Rika dodges and twists around, allowing her to target Kurobuchi's back after she gets away.
【Kasumi】
Haaah, haaah, haaah...!
Kurobuchi is out of breath, her form unsteady due to the exhaustion.
【Rika】
Sacchan!
【Rika】
This is fun, right? Isn't having fun the best feeling in the world?!
【Kasumi】
Ah...!
After a moment's hesitation, Kurobuchi stares right at Rika.
【Kasumi】
Yeah, this is fun... So much fun!
【Rika】
See!
The two of them nod in unison.
【Kasumi】
Okay, I'm coming at you again!
【Rika】
Sure, bring it on!
It's like I'm watching two kids playing FC. There's an innocence in their competition as they focus on the pure joy of the sport.
It probably lasted no more than two minutes.
But I'm sure those two minutes were worth a lifetime to them.
The match ends. It's 6:0. Rika Ichinose is the winner.
It was a one-sided game from start to finish, but the way it unfolded...
Well, it was far more frantic than any game you're likely to see.
It was a fight between two people with their beliefs on the line.
【Kasumi】
......
Kurobuchi is stunned.
Rika approaches her.
【Rika】
...That was a fun match.
She says.
【Kasumi】
You really are strong... Ricchan.
Kurobuchi replies.
【Rika】
Huh... Uh...?
Then, she returns to the shore.
【Masaya】
You did it, Rika.
【Rika】
Yes. Um... Masaya-san.
【Masaya】
What's up?
【Rika】
Sacchan just called me Ricchan, like she used to.
【Masaya】
I see.
【Rika】
Do you think... my feelings got through to her?
【Masaya】
If nothing else, your enthusiasm <i>definitely</i> reached her. The match wouldn't have turned out that way otherwise.
You don't see that final exchange of skill in most normal matches. It was a sight to behold.
With how she decided to abandon her dirty tactics and face Rika...
I doubt she imagined that "Ricchan."
【Masaya】
Right, let's get ready for the next match.
【Rika】
Okay!
Rika answers as she descends down to follow me.
And yet, her eyes remain fixated on Kurobuchi's retreating form.
【Misaki】
Phew, we're finally done.
【Mashiro】
It flew right by us...
The fall tournament has finally come to a close.
The awards ceremony has just ended, and all the schools are getting ready to head back.
【Madoka】
Good job, everyone. You guys worked real hard.
Madoka congratulates us.
【Madoka】
I sure am glad we hit our goal.
【Misaki】
Mhm...
【Mashiro】
Feels like a cause for celebration.
Yeah, maybe.
【Asuka】
No way!
Well, at least one person seems to disagree.
【Misaki】
You're <i>still</i> angry, Asuka?
【Asuka】
Yeah, 'cause... 'Cause we lost...
【Asuka】
Now we have to wait until the next tournament again...
【Misaki】
You're such a silly kitty, Asuka.
【Mashiro】
The tournament's only just ended, but she wants to go again...
Misaki and Mashiro seem almost annoyed by her behavior, but Asuka remains grumpy.
Makes sense, since she seems pretty disappointed by her results.
As far as Kunahama Academy is concerned, both Misaki and Asuka made it to the third round.
If either of them had won their match, we would have achieved our goal. However, Misaki lost to Ganeko-san, and Asuka lost to Saki Inui.
And so, unfortunately, the two of them were relegated to the top eight.
【Madoka】
Trust me, Asuka-chan, I tooooootally get how you feel, but we reached our goal, yeah?
【Mashiro】
Yeah, Rika-san did well.
【Asuka】
Urghhhhhh, but, but, but!
Asuka looks up like she's about to scream.
【Asuka】
God! I just wanted to face as many people as I could!
...Man, Asuka's incredible.
The fact that she wants to win, not to feel successful, but to discover her next challenge has her towering above the rest.
【Masaya】
(I wonder how far she could've gone if I chose to focus on her instead...)
There's no point thinking about what ifs, but I still can't help myself.
I really am looking forward to seeing her perform in the next tournament.
【Rika】
Good job out there!
【Satouin】
Fantastic work.
Right as I begin to get lost in my fantasies, the pair from Takafuji comes over, having finished tidying up their area.
【Madoka】
Oh, here they are.
【Misaki】
Nice one.
【Mashiro】
Good work!
I walk over to Rika.
【Masaya】
Well done, Rika.
【Rika】
Thank you very much.
I smile at her and hold out my hand.
【Masaya】
Congrats on making the top four.
【Rika】
Thank you again.
Rika takes my hand and returns my smile.
In the end, only Rika managed to achieve our joint goal.
For Kunahama, it's a net positive. But for Takafuji, it proves that they're still a force to be reckoned with even without Shindou-san.
【Satouin】
Your performance was incredible, Ichinose-san. Thanks to you, we can return home with our heads held high.
【Masaya】
You got unlucky, Satouin-san. I bet you could've got past the second round if you faced someone else.
【Satouin】
Indeed, I was completely negligent. I still cannot believe that suspicious Masked Skywalker bested me.
【Misaki】
Oh yeah... The masked freak beat Satouin-san.
【Mashiro】
They were surprisingly strong...
【Satouin】
Regardless!
Satouin-san stamps her foot, clearly not wanting to discuss her own results.
【Satouin】
I must thank you, Masaya Hinata.
【Masaya】
I've got a feeling I know where you're going with this, but there's no need.
Rika only got this far because of her own hard work and determination.
Sure, I acted as her coach and second, but in the end, I didn't really do all that much.
【Satouin】
No, I simply must.
【Satouin】
I believe you, of all people, are worthy of inheriting my "in."
【Masaya】
I knew it! Seriously, that "in" is for you and you alone, Satouin-san.
【Satouin】
Hinatain... It has a beautiful ring to it.
【Misaki】
Yeah, sounds like a perfect fit.
【Madoka】
I feel like this is the birth of a new era...
【Masaya】
What era? Hey, Rika, c'mon, say--
I'm about to tell her to say something, but I quickly swallow my words.
【Rika】
......
For some reason, she's gone silent.
【Masaya】
Rika?
Rika's expression suddenly grows tense.
【Masaya】
Huh...?
I sense something and spin around.
【Kasumi】
......
【Satouin】
Kasumi Kurobuchi...
【Misaki】
Yikes...!
【Mashiro】
What, again?!
【Madoka】
Eek!
Everyone pipes up in surprise and dread.
Makes sense. She's already caused us enough problems for one lifetime.
【Masaya】
Why are <i>you</i> here?
I stand in front of the girls to shield them.
I dunno what she's got planned, but depending on what it is, I might have to report her to the tournament staff.
【Rika】
Um, Masaya-san.
【Masaya】
Hm?
【Rika】
Sacchan seems different...
【Masaya】
Different how? Oh!
I take another look at her.
Her usual ominous aura has completely vanished.
Now that I think about it, her speech is lacking its usual sinister edge as well...
Before, Kurobuchi was like a suspicious black cat, but now she's more like a sad stray.
【Masaya】
Uh...
I try to soften my tone and ask what she wants again, but...
【Kasumi】
U-Um, um...!
【Kasumi】
I-I'm so sorry!
【Masaya】
...Huh?
The stray kitten utters an earnest apology.
【Kasumi】
I-I said so many horrible things to all of you, not to mention how I hurt you...
【Kasumi】
I'm... really sorry...
【Kasumi】
I had to apologize... I just knew I had to, and I couldn't bear it...
【Kasumi】
I-I really mean it... Um...
Oh. Well then...
This is the real Kasumi Kurobuchi, huh?
There's nothing left of her aloof, edgy persona in her tone. Instead, the way she's apologizing reveals her insecurities.
No, wait, maybe this is another trick?
But by the end of her match with Rika, something had changed...
Yeah, that must mean this is the real, true Kasumi Kurobuchi.
【Misaki】
You're kinda late.
Misaki's pretty damn pissed.
【Mashiro】
You did horrible things to Asuka-senpai and the people from Takafuji.
Mashiro's the next to chime in. Neither of them even try to hide the expressions of anger on their face.
Yeah, we can't just pretend she hasn't wronged us.
Sure, we managed to participate in the fall tournament, but we barely made it because of her. Our star player, Asuka, couldn't practice much because of her, so everyone underperformed.
And what's more, the one who suffered the most...
【Satouin】
I won't forgive you.
【Rika】
Satouin-senpai...
Was Satouin-san, both personally, and through the damage done to the Takafuji players she leads.
【Kasumi】
...Yes, I know. I wasn't expecting you to.
Kurobuchi's expression remains meek.
And Satouin-san...
【Satouin】
I think you may be misunderstanding something.
【Kasumi】
Huh...?
【Satouin】
Did anybody say you would be allowed to flee without receiving punishment?
【Kasumi】
Oh, um, I...
【Satouin】
Are you not aware of the Japanese proverb passed down from time immemorial? An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
Uh, I'm pretty sure that wasn't invented by us...
Does she seriously believe that?
【Satouin】
And so, I give you this!
She takes some sort of paper out from her breast pocket.
Then, she spreads it out and thrusts it before Kurobuchi.
【Satouin】
A letter of challenge, Kasumi Kurobuchi!
【Misaki】
No way!
【Mashiro】
A-A letter?!
【Madoka】
Of challenge?!
【Rika】
Ngh!
Everyone around us gasps in surprise.
【Asuka】
Ah...!
However, the one person who's experienced this before seems almost happy.
I think there's something wrong with her...
【Kasumi】
Um, I don't think I, well...
【Satouin】
What's the matter? Weren't you desperate to face us before, with all your talk of having a practice match?
【Kasumi】
Oh, but, I...
【Satouin】
...I saw your match with Rika.
【Kasumi】
Ah...!
【Rika】
Satouin-senpai...
【Satouin】
The way you were using your techniques in rapid succession toward the end... was quite captivating.
【Kasumi】
Oh no... I really...
【Satouin】
Why show such humility now?
【Kasumi】
Huh...?
【Satouin】
You're capable of something quite wondrous. Why keep that locked away inside yourself?
【Rika】
Ah...!
Those words...
Though they were spoken to Kurobuchi, they also reached Rika.
【Satouin】
Deciding one's own worth is a luxury not afforded to many.
【Kasumi】
Oh no... I wasn't...
【Satouin】
Then pay attention to what other people have to say about you.
【Kasumi】
Ah...!
【Satouin】
You can remain a big fish in a small pond if that makes things easier for you, but then you will never discover a way to grow.
【Satouin】
To become a salmon, one must move to the ocean. You may be afraid of a bear's paws, but you must leave your children behind and survive...
【Satouin】
...I no longer understand the purpose of this analogy, but that's beside the point!
She thrusts her letter of challenge forward once again.
【Satouin】
I wish to fight you once more, so accept and give me the match I desire!
【Kasumi】
O-Okay, then... I'll do it. I'll face you.
Kurobuchi nods as she accepts the challenge, overwhelmed by Satouin-san's intensity.
【Asuka】
Kurobuchi-san!
【Kasumi】
Y-Yesss!
Asuka similarly thrusts a paper out toward her.
【Asuka】
I have a letter of challenge too!
【Masaya】
...You brought one with you?
This is just like when she gave one to Rika...
【Kasumi】
Eek...! O-Okay!
【Asuka】
You'll do it, right? You'll face me up in the sky?!
【Kasumi】
O-Of course, I'd be happy to...!
This situation is so absurd that I feel like I shouldn't get involved.
In any case, it's clear that the two girls who have suffered the most at Kurobuchi's hands have forgiven her.
【Misaki】
Ugh, fiiine! If the people who got injured are over it, I won't stay mad.
【Mashiro】
Okay, I'll cast my anger aside too.
They backed down pretty fast.
【Kasumi】
I'm sorry... I'm really sorry.
Kurobuchi has been forgiven, but she keeps her head bowed low.
Right when I'm wondering what to do, someone steps forward.
【Masaya】
Rika...
【Rika】
......
Rika...
She stands in front of Kurobuchi and attempts to talk.
【Kasumi】
I'm so... sorry?
Kurobuchi raises her head.
Rika looks at her and gently smiles.
【Rika】
Do you think we can have another match sometime?
【Kasumi】
But...
【Rika】
I don't want this to be the end.
【Kasumi】
But I'm... I mean...
【Rika】
You know, there's someone I've always wanted to face.
【Kasumi】
Huh...?
【Rika】
There was this girl I knew who taught me FC, and we got along great.
【Kasumi】
Ah!
【Rika】
But then I moved away, so we lost contact. Still, I've always remembered the promise we made, to one day compete against each other in an FC tournament.
【Rika】
That promise is so important to me, even now... I want it to come true.
【Kasumi】
You still remember that, Ricchan?
【Rika】
Yeah, I never once forgot it... Strange, right?
【Kasumi】
Huh...? It's not strange. Not at all.
【Rika】
Huh?
【Kasumi】
Our promise will definitely come true. I'll work hard to make sure it does.
【Kasumi】
So... I'm looking forward to it.
【Rika】
Hehe, me too.
Rika smiles.
【Rika】
Can you show me your face for a second, Sacchan?
【Kasumi】
Huh? Okay...
Kurobuchi raises her head to let Rika get a good look at her.
【Rika】
......
【Rika】
You really are cute, Sacchan.
【Kasumi】
......
【Kasumi】
...Thank you, Ricchan.
【Rika】
No problem.
Kurobuchi bows to us several more times before eventually disappearing into the crowd.
Only this time, she seems almost invigorated.
Guess she finally knows what she has to do.
【Rika】
Thank you so much for forgiving Sacchan, Asuka-san, Satouin-senpai.
Rika turns to face us and bows.
【Asuka】
This turned out great. You actually got to talk to her normally.
Asuka replies with a smile.
【Rika】
Yes, it really did.
【Satouin】
Ichinose-san... No, Rika.
On the other hand, Satouin-san's expression remains stern.
【Rika】
Y-Yes?!
Rika tenses up as she stands to attention.
【Satouin】
...You've created another powerful rival who will bar your path.
Satouin-san says, unable to stop a grin forming on her face.
【Rika】
Ah...!
【Rika】
Yes, yes I have!
Rika replies happily.
【Satouin】
Now then, it is time for us to return home. Everything that has happened has left me starving.
【Misaki】
You said it, Satouin-san! My stomach's been killing me... I can't take it much longer!
【Mashiro】
We can't have you fainting, Senpai! Eat me instead!
【Madoka】
You never pass up any chances you get, huh?
【Asuka】
Oh, yeah, I'm also really hungry!
【Masaya】
Right, let's have a little celebration, or rather a review meeting, and grab some food!
【Misaki】
Yaaay! Yes to the food, no to the meeting!
【Mashiro】
Saaame!
These two really come alive at times like this. Someone save me.
The girls start talking about what they want to get to eat, so I leave them be and head over to Rika.
【Masaya】
Rika.
【Rika】
Masaya-san...
【Masaya】
Good job, Rika.
【Rika】
...Thanks.
Rika nods.
I can sense the strength of someone who's just overcome a previously insurmountable hurdle in her gaze.
This tournament has come to a close, for both Takafuji and Kunahama.
Our overall results may not have been too impressive, but we've still gained a lot.
【Masaya】
Haaah... It's finally over.
【Rika】
Yes...
It's been several hours since the end of the tournament.
Rika got in touch with me, saying she couldn't sleep, so I got her to join me on a short flight.
Rika's an endless fountain of conversation topics.
And I have fun discussing them all, from the trivial to the serious.
Before we know it, it's completely dark out as we float through the sky.
【Rika】
Masaya-san.
She calls out my name during a moment of silence.
Wonder what she wants...
【Masaya】
What's up?
Rika turns toward me.
The expression on her face is gentle and relaxed.
【Rika】
I was just thinking...
【Rika】
It's amazing how having fun changes everything.
【Masaya】
...Oh yeah?
Aoi-san always told me to have fun when she trained me.
But I eventually turned my back on that idea.
And yet, now I'm the one telling that to someone new.
It feels like my past and my present have finally converged, leading to a bright new future.
【Rika】
It even got Sacchan to have a change of heart...
【Rika】
"Fun" is a magical word that can change lives.
It sure is.
It makes you feel like you do anything, like you can open your heart to anyone.
But it's also something that can harm people who are already at the depths of despair.
And so, it's not something you can just throw around willy-nilly.
It's a powerful, but dangerous tool.
【Rika】
Do you think I managed to help Sacchan a little, like how you helped me?
【Masaya】
Definitely.
【Rika】
I hope you're right.
Rika smiles.
But this time, it isn't the least bit fake.
It's a genuine expression of joy.
【Masaya】
I know you'll be fine, Rika.
【Rika】
Masaya-san...
【Masaya】
You're more than strong enough to help people on your own now. I know that better than anyone.
【Rika】
Thank you very much.
I don't need a thank you...
【Rika】
Please stay exactly where you are.
【Masaya】
Hm? Uh, sure...
I smile as I face Rika.
Rika takes my free hand in hers, then wraps her other one behind my back.
【Rika】
Hehehe...
And after that, she giggles happily.
It's an innocent laugh that's free of all worries.
【Masaya】
You know, it kinda feels like we're dancing.
【Rika】
Do you want to try? I don't exactly know how, but I'm willing to give it a shot.
【Masaya】
Same... Let's start with a twirl.
【Rika】
Okay!
We stretch our arms out as far as possible and use centrifugal force to do a quick spin.
The stars in the distance spin with us, looking oh so beautiful on the canvas of night.
【Rika】
It's so pretty...
【Masaya】
Yeah.
Occasionally, Rika's body presses against mine as we spin and our lips touch.
We've kissed countless times before.
But it's something we'll never grow tired of. Each new one is still fresh and exciting.
【Rika】
I'll love you until the end of time, Masaya-san.
Those words make it clear that Rika is looking at the present... and our future.
She may be influenced by the past, but she won't let it hold her back.
And that makes me think the same thing will happen to me as long as I remain by her side.
Seeing her grow has taught me that there's more to be gained from accepting the past than rejecting it.
I can't be sure that I'll ever overcome my trauma...
But I believe that day will come as long as we stick together.
【Masaya】
I love you too, Rika.
Our silhouettes hover in the starry sky.
We don't part for a moment, remaining one for as long as we can.
【Misaki】
Phew... I'm all done, Coach.
【Masaya】
Great, now go do three more sets!
【Misaki】
Huh?! You've gotta be kidding me!
【Mashiro】
Finishing one set was hard enough, and now we have to do three more?
【Masaya】
I'm totally serious. Look, Asuka's already on it with zero complaints.
【Asuka】
Did you say something?
Asuka responds through her headset as she zips around.
【Masaya】
Hey, Asuka, you're gonna do five sets, yeah?
【Asuka】
Yessir! I'll do my best!
【Misaki】
Curse that demon and her stamina...
【Mashiro】
Asuka-senpai is a bottomless swamp. Please don't lump a small puddle like me in with her.
【Masaya】
Better start digging so you become a pond, then.
【Mashiro】
That's impossible! The sun'll set before I get anywhere close!
【Misaki】
It'll be <i>sun</i>set before we even finish <i>one</i> set!
【Masaya】
You seem real fired up, Misaki. Should I make that four sets instead of three?
【Misaki】
Oh, no, you must've misheard. I didn't say anything at all!
【Mashiro】
Why'd you have to say that, Misaki-senpai?!
【Misaki】
Oh no, I didn't say anything. This guy just tried to pile on an extra set for no reason. He's a demon, I tell you!
【Masaya】
Complain all you want. You want to improve, don't you?
【Misaki】
Well... I guess...
【Mashiro】
I'm <i>definitely</i> going to beat that burnt hotdog next time!
【Masaya】
Better work hard and get those three sets done before the sun goes down, then.
【Misaki】
Monster! Demon! Gimme some udon!
【Mashiro】
Please give me back my peaceful life with Misaki-senpai! This is hell on Earth!
I leave those crybabies behind and head over to Madoka, who's sprawled out along the coast.
【Masaya】
Hey, get up!
I give her exposed belly a gentle kick.
【Madoka】
OWWW!
【Madoka】
Whoa, it's just you, Hinata-kun. Almost gave me a heart attack there.
【Masaya】
Can't believe you were sleeping on the job, Madoka.
【Madoka】
It was just a light nap. Still, it feels like an elephant just stepped on me...
Wow, rude much?
【Masaya】
Shouldn't you be making a call?
We're supposed to have a joint practice session with Takafuji.
Rika's the vice-president over there now, so Madoka was supposed to call her to confirm ahead of time, but we're behind schedule because she forgot.
【Madoka】
Oh, right. Heh, guess I'll get your cute little wife on the phone.
【Masaya】
Maybe you need another kick.
【Madoka】
Oh, so you <i>did</i> step on me, huh? I'll have to report that to your wife!
【Masaya】
Quiet, dumbass.
【Madoka】
Croaaak...
Madoka croaks like a frog as her life flashes before her eyes.
Ignoring her, I make the call myself.
【Masaya】
Hello?
【Rika】
Right, okay, you're just about to head over.
【Rika】
Us? Yeah, the president's ready. Okay, we'll save the rest for when we meet.
【Rika】
...Huh? Hehe, I love you too. See you soon.
【Rika】
Hehehe...
【Satouin】
Well, I certainly never expected to hear such romantic words during a business call.
【Rika】
Whoa, Prez! H-How long have you been there?!
【Satouin】
A short while. Wasn't it you who said we should get going once preparations are complete?
【Rika】
I'm sorry. I've pulled myself together, so let's get going!
【Satouin】
Stop! Wait for me, sheesh...
【Satouin】
What a bad influence he is, truly.
【Kasumi】
Right, then let's go with this plan from next week.
【Mutsuki】
We're finally free from having to play dirty, huh? You got them real riled up, Bucchi.
【Miyuki】
I don't care if it's tradition or whatever, being forced to play dirty like that sucked. Everyone hated us.
【Mutsuki】
Still, you gotta admit it was a shock when they suddenly changed advisors on us.
【Miyuki】
I heard a teacher from Kunahama came to visit and chewed our old one out.
【Kasumi】
In any case, we're not doing that anymore. We'll play to have fun, like we should.
【Mutsuki】
Wow, I can't even remember the last time someone told us to play for fun.
【Miyuki】
It was like a banned word around these parts. We even got told <i>not</i> to have fun.
【Mutsuki】
You were so into it that we were even too scared to approach you. I'm <i>really</i> glad you're finally back to normal.
【Mutsuki】
Though now all our seniors are gone, so it's just us three left.
【Kasumi】
Yeah... But I think that's a good thing.
【Miyuki】
True that.
【Mutsuki】
You've got this, Ms. President.
【Kasumi】
...Thanks.
【Kasumi】
So, I think we should start using nicknames to improve our relationships.
【Kasumi】
And on that note, I'm counting on you, Mucchan, Micchan.
【Miyuki】
Oooh, yeah, yeah, that's great.
【Mutsuki】
Let's do this, Sacchan.
【Kasumi】
Huh? Wait, why Sacchan...?
【Mutsuki】
Uh, 'cause going with Kacchan makes you sound like a boy. Sacchan's way cuter.
【Miyuki】
And you said you just changed your last name recently, so turning Kurobuchi into Bucchi doesn't really work.
【Kasumi】
Oh...
【Kasumi】
Hehe, okay. Sacchan sounds good.
【Mutsuki】
Sweet, it's time for Dougaura to get a fresh start!
【Miyuki】
Here we go!
【Kasumi】
Yeah!
Our joint practice session with Takafuji has started. These have become a regular occurrence.
Rika's gone around observing everyone, and has even taken the initiative and started instructing them.
She's no longer forcing herself to act diligent or imitate Asuka.
This is her true self, and her devotion to FC is clear as day.
【Rika】
Masaya-san! We're all set!
Rika informs me that she's done setting up the practice match schedule.
【Masaya】
Okay, then go do three sets.
【Rika】
Understood!
【Asuka】
Rika-chan, can you help me?
【Rika】
Sure!
Their words echo through the clear sky.
Rika's voice may not be as cheerful as before, but it sounds far better because it's more natural.
And so, I call out to her in a show of support.
【Masaya】
Go out there and have fun, Rika!
【Rika】
Roger!
