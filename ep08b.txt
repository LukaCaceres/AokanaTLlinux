【Misaki】
Uggghhh!
I call out to Misaki as she runs along the beach.
【Masaya】
Lift your knees up higher, you're losing speed.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah...!
Misaki pants harder as she raises her knees and accelerates.
【Masaya】
Don't give up, you're almost there! You've got this in the bag!
Misaki finally arrives at the finish line I've marked in the sand.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah!
She staggers to a halt, throwing her head back to stare up at the sky as she gasps for air.
【Masaya】
Don't stop, you need to keep moving. Otherwise, the lactic acid will build up in your muscles. It may be hard, but I need you to do a light jog back to the start position.
Lactic acid builds up in muscles as you exercise, which is what makes you feel fatigued. It stops being produced when you finish, but it also takes longer to drain from your muscles, which can leave a person more tired in the long run.
Light movement helps it drain without building up an excess, so any decent training program will include a cooldown period.
However...
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah!
While it's easier on your muscles, it's harder on your lungs. When it comes to pain, it's far harder to endure the feeling that your lungs are about to explode.
【Masaya】
I know you want to stop to catch your breath, but it's best for your muscles that you keep moving.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah... Mmm! What's with this hellish warm up routine? Why aren't we jumping straight into the flying?
【Masaya】
You thought this was a warm up? You're not doing any flying today.
【Misaki】
Huh? Come again? I'm not flying? But flying is fun! That's the whole reason I play FC!
【Masaya】
You're not flying today, and you're not flying tomorrow. Hell, you probably won't even fly the day after.
【Misaki】
You monster! I can't believe you'd bully me so bad I'd feel sick!
【Masaya】
This isn't bullying.
【Misaki】
I'm being bullied mentally and physically, but I'm not having any fun!
【Masaya】
Well, no shit.
【Misaki】
Mmm, I mean, y'know, everyone's different.
【Masaya】
Don't just assume I'll get what you mean. If you're gonna be sick, then do it while running.
【Misaki】
You actually just told me to throw up while exercising!
【Masaya】
Quit complaining and get back to running already. If you can keep mouthing running, you're not gonna be sick.
I would actually stop practice if I thought she was going to be sick, mind you.
【Misaki】
Ughhhhhh! I quit! I can't take this!
【Masaya】
As if I'd let you! I thought you were ready for the pain?!
【Misaki】
You never said that included running!
【Masaya】
Well, that was dumb. Every sport uses running.
【Misaki】
Even thumb wrestling? Do they run to warm up for that?
【Masaya】
Feel free to name as many exceptions as you like, you're still gonna run.
【Misaki】
Ugh, this is too much. Ah... You're a monster, Masaya! Somebody, save me! There's a monster trying to eat me!
I grab her hand and start dragging her at a light jog back toward the starting position.
【Masaya】
Get running, unless you want your muscles to hurt even worse.
【Misaki】
There are more important things to do! I haven't flown in days already. I need to slip on my Grav Shoes and get back in my groove--
【Masaya】
Not happening.
【Misaki】
Why? Everyone else gets to train at Takafuji, where they have proper equipment, but I'm stuck running in the sand.
【Masaya】
The sand is more than enough for you, Misaki. You can even use it as a toilet when you need to.
【Misaki】
I'm not a cat! God! What's the point of FC if you don't get to fly?!
【Masaya】
Quit being so impatient.
【Misaki】
I was <i>born</i> impatient! Is this to train my willpower or something?! Are you trying to break me down like they do in the army to--
【Masaya】
You've got the wrong idea. I'm not here to break you down.
【Misaki】
Then what--
【Masaya】
What'll you do?
【Misaki】
Huh?
【Masaya】
What'll you do if you face Asuka in a match?
【Misaki】
Are we talking about my mental state here?
【Masaya】
We're talking about your body.
【Misaki】
My body? Like, how sexy I am?
【Masaya】
You know as well as I do that this isn't the time to discuss your looks.
【Misaki】
I can tell you have trouble figuring out where to look, is all.
【Masaya】
You can stop fantasizing while you're at it. I'm your coach, and you're my player. It doesn't matter how sexy you are, I won't have any trouble looking at you.
【Misaki】
How <i>manly</i> of you. What about if I was naked?
【Masaya】
Wouldn't bother me. I can switch myself off at times like this.
When girls are in P.E., their sweat makes their bras stand out through their shirts, but I can put my hand on my heart and say that's never gotten a rise out of me.
These things are all about your state of mind.
Though, if I somehow accidentally peeked on girls changing, then I might find my switch being flipped without meaning to.
I was <i>so</i> close to seeing Misaki's tits back then...
Misaki peers at me with an odd look on her face.
【Misaki】
Hm? You imagining something pervy?
【Masaya】
I am not!
Do I really make a weird face when I think about these things? Madoka pointed it out once, too.
【Misaki】
But if you saw me naked when you weren't acting as my coach--
【Masaya】
You're trying to drag out this conversation so you can rest for longer, aren't you?
【Misaki】
Ugh...
Misaki averts her gaze.
【Misaki】
Hahahaha, I don't have the slightest idea what you mean, Coach.
【Masaya】
What do you think would happen if you faced Asuka as you are right now?
【Misaki】
Like, literally?
【Masaya】
Yeah. Say the fall tournament was today, and you were up against Asuka in the finals. What would happen?
【Misaki】
I'm sure I wouldn't win, but I'm even more sure I wouldn't lose.
【Masaya】
You'd lose, 100%.
【Misaki】
...The gap between us is that wide already?
【Masaya】
You'd lose to Satouin-san or Ichinose, too. You'd probably beat Mashiro. That's the level you're on.
【Misaki】
You really mean that? Oh, I get it. You're exaggerating to try and get me fired up, right?
【Masaya】
Not at all. I'm serious.
【Misaki】
Has everyone improved, or have I just gotten worse?
【Masaya】
You have to get through several rounds to get to the finals.
【Misaki】
Yeah, I know that.
【Masaya】
So, assuming you actually made it, you'd be totally worn out. Just flying along the first line would have you out of breath, so you'd obviously lose.
【Misaki】
......
【Masaya】
You know as well as I do that you're lacking stamina. To make matters worse, you haven't practiced at all since the summer tournament.
【Misaki】
...You're right.
【Masaya】
It hurts to not be able to perform at full strength.
【Misaki】
Yeah, it <i>really</i> does.
【Masaya】
And I doubt you want to have to console yourself with the thought that you could've won if you were at full strength.
【Misaki】
...No, I don't.
【Masaya】
So we have to start by strengthening your body. And that means more cardio and getting rid of that unnecessary fat.
【Misaki】
Yeah... You're right.
【Masaya】
This will form the basis for everything we're going to do. You won't get anywhere without it, Misaki.
【Misaki】
I get it already. Haaah, I'll do my best.
【Masaya】
I know this is physically demanding practice, and it's going to be hard, but--
【Misaki】
Don't worry, I'm not gonna leave or run away at this point. Just tell me what today's schedule is first. I need to prepare myself.
【Masaya】
One set will comprise of five 100 meter sprints, followed by a break, followed by five 200 meter sprints. We'll start with three sets.
【Misaki】
I'm going home! I'm like, 100% sure you set this up to drive me away!
【Masaya】
You promised you wouldn't say that! Do you always break promises this quickly?!
【Misaki】
You're gonna kill me! I can already see death awaiting me!
【Masaya】
Just get running already. I want you at full sprint.
We've reached the starting position, so I let go of Misaki's hand and stop dragging her.
【Misaki】
Ugh, you've been bullying me this whole time, but I'm still not having any fun!
【Masaya】
If you've got the breath to make that joke, you've got the breath to get running!
【Misaki】
Ughhh! Fiiine! I'm ready now.
【Masaya】
You've said that like fifty times today.
【Misaki】
But I actually mean it this time!
Misaki brings her hands up to her face like she's scooping water and gently claps her cheeks.
【Misaki】
Let's get this show on the road!
【Masaya】
Sure thing. Ready, set, go!
【Misaki】
Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
【Misaki】
No way! Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah! Mmm! I'm gonna die. I'm <i>actually</i> gonna die. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel!
【Masaya】
Oh, give me a break. Let me see your wrist. I need to check your pulse.
Misaki holds her arm out toward me.
【Misaki】
Mmm, haaah, haaah, haaah, what? Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, got an interest in my heart rate?
【Masaya】
We're training your heart and lungs here, so obviously.
I press my thumb against her wrist while using the clock on my phone to measure her pulse.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah... Mmm... Hahahaha!
Misaki laughs once she's done catching her breath.
【Misaki】
Is feeling my heart racing getting yours racing too?
【Masaya】
Nope. Why do you keep making up these weird fetishes?
【Misaki】
Like, you might end up asking me to do something <i>really</i> extreme later on, so I thought I should get myself ready.
【Masaya】
Relax, that won't happen.
【Misaki】
I dunno, that's making me feel even more nervous.
【Masaya】
Great.
Misaki hops backward..
【Misaki】
G-Great? What, you mean you enjoy that?
【Masaya】
No. Man, you sure can joke for someone who's supposedly exhausted.
I pull my thumb off her wrist.
【Masaya】
That's the end of the sprints.
【Misaki】
Huh, already? What's next?
【Masaya】
That's it for today's practice, too.
【Misaki】
Huh? Doesn't feel much like special training to me unless I'm collapsed, almost lifeless on the ground from exhaustion, looking up at you with lifeless eyes.
【Masaya】
I'm a coach, not a torturer. I wouldn't push you to that point.
【Misaki】
I don't get why this is the end. I can still keep going.
【Masaya】
Your pulse has reached its peak and you've already done the number of sets I asked for. More would just backfire on us.
【Misaki】
How?
【Masaya】
It's not "the more you do the better" here. You ever heard of overworking yourself?
【Misaki】
Maybe once or twice.
Essentially, training too hard weakens your body.
【Misaki】
So doing more would be overworking myself?
【Masaya】
Exactly. The exercise would actually weaken your muscles.
【Misaki】
Huh? Doing more exercise can make you weaker? Seriously?
【Masaya】
Exercise actually weakens your muscles. It's the recovery period that makes them stronger. However, if you exercise too much, you weaken your muscles more than they're able to recover. We have to wear you out to a point, then let you recover.
【Misaki】
Wear me out to a point, then let me recover? Man, you sound like an abusive husband.
【Masaya】
Your muscles will grow more efficiently if you put them through cycles of strength and weakness.
I was taught all this by Aoi-san.
Doing five to ten mile runs on a daily basis isn't an efficient way of increasing your stamina.
It might be necessary in sports that require you to run for a long amount of time or cover large distances, but FC meets neither criteria.
【Misaki】
Hm, I get it. And here I was thinking we'd be practicing so long I'd go crazy. Y'know, kinda like how you see people collapsing on the floor and pouring water over themselves.
【Masaya】
I wouldn't push you that hard. Though, I guess that might be up to you.
Misaki laughs timidly.
【Misaki】
Hahahaha... Oh really?
【Masaya】
It's your decision to make in the end, not mine.
【Misaki】
Hm, what decision?
【Masaya】
How much you feel you need to get the hang of things before you improve, I guess.
【Misaki】
Hm, yeah that is something to think about.
【Masaya】
Practicing for ages and ages until you collapse <i>is</i> one way of getting the hang of things.
【Misaki】
Hm...
【Masaya】
But it also isn't.
【Misaki】
...What do you mean?
【Masaya】
I don't really know if it works, but truly strong people all seem to have experienced that sort of thing.
Most of their time is spent just doing normal practice sessions, but they often seem to go through really brutal sessions for short periods of time.
【Masaya】
There are a lot of emotions that come with playing FC. There'll be times where you know you're overworking yourself, but you feel you have to get out there and fly.
【Misaki】
And there are things you can only learn through that, huh?
【Masaya】
There's no need to stress over it. The most likely conclusion we'll come to is that it's bad for your fitness.
【Misaki】
Hm, so what'll we do for the rest of the day? Go home? Fly in the sky? Join the mile-high club?
【Masaya】
We're gonna make you smarter.
【Misaki】
<i>Excuse</i> you! I've never even come close to failing a test.
【Masaya】
I'm not talking about school, dumbass. We're going to get you a mind for FC.
【Misaki】
A head for FC... How do I get one of those?
【Masaya】
A mind for... Actually, I guess head works too.
【Masaya】
Um, I'd prefer to talk about this somewhere we won't stand out.
【Misaki】
Can't we go to a cafe or something?
【Masaya】
Nah, this could get embarrassing.
【Misaki】
I-It could?
【Masaya】
It's not what you're thinking about, trust me.
【Misaki】
Wh-What are you trying to imply about my imagination, kind sir?!
【Masaya】
What's with the sudden formality? Look, I just wanna go somewhere we won't be interrupted.
【Misaki】
How about my place? My grandma should still be out in the vegetable garden around this time, so you've got nothing to worry about.
【Masaya】
Yeah, sounds good.
【Misaki】
Masaya's coming to my house to spend some time alone with me and do something embarrassing... Eek! What's gonna happen to me?!
【Masaya】
Quit trying to provoke me. Look, I brought something to use.
I take it out of my bag.
【Misaki】
Th-That's...
Misaki is momentarily at a loss for words.
【Masaya】
I brought two of them, but it looks like you brought your own.
【Misaki】
I always keep my little Masaya with me!
Misaki and I pull out the Mr. Shitou plushies I won in the crane game at the arcade.
She points her Mr. Shitou at me and bends him over.
【Misaki】
Good day, Masaya-kun.
I also point my Mr. Shitou at Misaki.
【Masaya】
Good day, Misaki-chan. Are you doing well?
【Misaki】
On every level except mentally!
【Masaya】
...One's mental state is very important for one's wellbeing, so please do be careful.
【Misaki】
On one hand I'm sad, but on the other, I've eaten my fill and exercised to exhaustion. My body feels great, but my mind is in a slump.
【Masaya】
When did things get so gloomy? I was just talking about using these to train your mind for FC.
【Misaki】
So presumably, Mr. Shitou will hypnotize me into learning everything I need to know... Oh, now I know why Shitou has the highest level of FC players in Japan.
【Masaya】
Quit going on tangents already! We're gonna use the plushies to simulate FC.
【Misaki】
We are?
【Masaya】
Yep.
I move Mr. Shitou horizontally, as if he's flying, and imitate him turning midair.
【Masaya】
We'll move them around like this and have a match between the two Mr. Shitous.
【Misaki】
Hm, feels kinda dumb, like we're kids playing with toys.
【Masaya】
You are a child most of the time, Misaki.
【Misaki】
What's so childish about these massive boobs?!
【Masaya】
Don't talk about yourself like that! I meant your mental age.
Misaki starts moving Mr. Shitou around willy-nilly.
【Misaki】
Hm, so this is gonna get me a head for FC?
【Masaya】
Moving it around all over the place might help you reach some sort of religious enlightenment, but it won't help your mind. You need to take this seriously and think about what you're doing.
【Misaki】
Couldn't we do this by actually flying?
【Masaya】
Nope. You try to win all your matches through instinct.
【Misaki】
Geez, I do think too!
【Masaya】
You might, but everyone else thinks <i>way</i> more.
【Misaki】
Th-They do?
【Masaya】
They do.
I answer firmly to make it stick in her mind.
【Masaya】
Since you win matches through intuition, you'll just do the exact same in practice.
【Misaki】
What else is there to dogfights other than intuition?
【Masaya】
There's a certain level of theory behind them, for one.
【Misaki】
But doesn't it come down to instinct in the heat of the moment?
【Masaya】
I trust your ability to make decisions in the heat of the moment, Misaki. But what I need to teach you is how to look at the match as a whole.
【Misaki】
Oh...?
【Masaya】
Mastering this will let you control the field... and control your opponent.
【Misaki】
......
Misaki stares at me through upturned eyes.
【Misaki】
...Is this how Asuka and Inui-san think?
I happened to check some FC fansites, and discovered that Inui had been nicknamed the "Monarch of the Skies" after not only winning the Shintou tournament, but also the national tournament several days later.
Accounts of the game don't seem to have worked out what Inui's playstyle is, but the nickname captured her essence perfectly.
I've watched videos, replayed the match inside my head...
I even went as far as to get Shindou-san's number from Ichinose so I could call him up and discuss it.
Now I'm sure that I can use these Mr. Shitous to teach Misaki about Inui's playstyle without having witnessed it more than once.
【Masaya】
For some reason, you always fall back on instinct when flying. At least practicing here, you get the time to calm down and think things through.
【Misaki】
With the Mr. Shitous, huh? But like, you're my second, Masaya. Can't you just do the thinking for me? I'll just follow your lead.
【Masaya】
It takes too long to instruct you unless we're already on the same page. There's no time for more than brief instructions in an actual match.
【Misaki】
Yeah, guess you have a point.
【Masaya】
Also, if you're focusing too much on what your second is saying, you won't be focusing enough on your opponent.
【Misaki】
Hm...
【Masaya】
Even though the best players still use seconds, they think things through for themselves. You could say they see nothing but their opponent during the match.
【Misaki】
I kinda know what you're getting at there.
【Masaya】
You were talking about fear and stuff after your match with Ichinose, right?
【Misaki】
Yeah.
There are things you discover about your opponent during matches that are hard to put into words.
What's important is how you decide to act when you feel those things.
【Masaya】
That wasn't something a second could instruct you on.
【Masaya】
Yes, you need to be following your second's instructions. But at the end of the day, a second's opinion is no more than that, an opinion. The ultimate decision is in your hands, Misaki.
【Misaki】
That so?
【Masaya】
You're the one who has to decide how to fly in the moment. And that's why we need to train your mind for FC.
Misaki gives a slightly exasperated nod.
【Misaki】
Aight. We may as well give this a go, since you're so passionate about it.
【Masaya】
Okay, let's start.
I look around Misaki's room.
【Masaya】
Um, we'll use the string for your lamp as the first, this part of the bookshelf as the second, the handle for your closet as third, and that stain on the wall as fourth.
【Misaki】
This has turned into a real pain.
【Masaya】
Less sass, more serious.
【Misaki】
Roger. So, what're our roles? I'm a Fighter and you're a Speeder?
【Masaya】
Your Mr. Shitou is you, my Mr. Shitou is Inui.
【Misaki】
Right. All I have to do is crush her, yeah?
【Masaya】
Go ahead and try.
【Misaki】
Roger.
【Masaya】
Okay, line up by first.
Misaki bobs her Mr. Shitou over.
【Misaki】
Ain't no darn tootin' way you're gonna beat me.
【Masaya】
I told you that Mr. Shitou was you.
【Misaki】
I always talk ta m'self like this.
【Masaya】
Quit fooling around and take this seriously.
【Misaki】
I know, I know. Whoa, a direct touch on Inui-san's chest!
【Masaya】
Take this seriously!
【Misaki】
I seriously touched her.
【Masaya】
If that was meant to be serious, then you better do that next time you meet Inui.
【Misaki】
Fine, I will! So after I've touched her, you have to do the same.
【Masaya】
Why the hell do we both have to grope her? We'll get kicked out of the venue before the tournament even begins!
【Misaki】
I would have no regrets!
【Masaya】
Well, do something about that...! Okay, we're starting now.
【Misaki】
I'm ready.
【Masaya】
Start!
【Misaki】
Aight! I'm jumping to the bookshelf.
【Masaya】
At least pretend this is real and say that you're going to the second line, I'm begging you.
【Misaki】
Fiiine! I transfer my soul into Mr. Shitou and zoooooom over to the second line.
【Masaya】
Well, I guess that counts as serious...
Misaki skips to the line between the bookshelf and the closet handle.
【Masaya】
Okay, I'm moving straight forward...
【Misaki】
You have to take this seriously too, Masaya. Pretend to be Inui-san.
【Masaya】
We need to take the <i>game</i> seriously. There's no need to pretend to be the persons themselves.
【Misaki】
There is, okay? This is all part of making it realistic. You've gotta growl at the start of every sentence, just like she does! Graaaw, I'm here to play FC!
【Masaya】
Inui doesn't talk like that!
【Misaki】
Graaaw, I'm all hot and horny up here.
【Masaya】
Why would Inui ever say that?
Misaki starts rotating her Mr. Shitou.
【Misaki】
I'm circling above the line and waiting.
【Masaya】
I touched second, scoring my first point, and now I'm using the repulsion from it to accelerate.
【Misaki】
I'm looking over at Inui-san while circling and waiting for her.
【Masaya】
I fly up above the line.
【Misaki】
I follow her lead and ascend! I challenge her to a dogfight from below.
【Masaya】
Inui goes along with your dogfight.
【Misaki】
Hah, hah, hah!
【Masaya】
Hah, hah, hah!
【Misaki】
...Is this seriously gonna help?
【Masaya】
Don't break character.
【Misaki】
Bam! I feint to the side, then use a reversal to get on top!
A reversal is a technique where you slip to the side of an opponent coming at you from above to position yourself above them instead.
【Masaya】
Inui reaches out a hand and taps you on the head.
【Misaki】
Hold on, can she do that?
【Masaya】
Easily. She has the height advantage. Remember, reversals are difficult.
When your opponent is at least somewhat competent, you have to focus on your timing and be unpredictable. If you don't master those two skills, you won't get anywhere.
If Misaki was facing Mashiro, she'd be able to pull it off, but against Inui she might succeed one time out of ten, if that.
【Misaki】
In that case, I throw in some more attacks from below, then descend! Inui-san chases after my tail. Now I've got her right where I--
【Masaya】
Not likely. Inui-san keeps her distance while she chases you, observing. She doesn't accept your invitation.
【Misaki】
Grr, then I'm going for a frontal attack! I ascend again!
【Masaya】
Inui focuses on ensuring that you don't climb any higher than her, rather than trying to score points on you.
Misaki starts bumping her Mr. Shitou into mine.
【Misaki】
Doesn't matter. With all the attacks I'm throwing at her, I've gotta score at least one point.
【Masaya】
Nope.
【Misaki】
Why not? Am I that bad?
【Masaya】
You're good. But I've never seen Inui actually engage in a dogfight, so I can't make a comparison.
【Misaki】
Doesn't that mean I'll definitely score a point?
【Masaya】
Take a moment to think about your positions.
【Misaki】
Huh?
【Masaya】
Both of you are facing down toward the water. You're trying to get vertical, so the most you'll manage is a forward bent posture.
【Misaki】
But that's the normal way of flying.
【Masaya】
We're trying to develop your mind here, remember? Try thinking about it for a moment.
【Misaki】
Hm...
【Masaya】
What do you have to do to score points in dogfights?
【Misaki】
To score points... Are we talking mind games here? Like, blank out your mind and go, kinda stuff?
【Masaya】
I'm telling you to think, not clear your mind. This is important. It's the first thing any beginner is taught.
【Misaki】
Hm... You've gotta touch their back to get a point... Oh! Ohhh, that's it, huh? Hm, wait, it's really that simple?
【Masaya】
Yes, it is.
【Misaki】
So then it's like this, yeah?
Misaki brings her Mr. Shitou level with mine.
【Misaki】
While I was below Inui-san, she could touch my back, but I couldn't reach hers.
An obvious conclusion, given both had their backs pointing upward.
【Masaya】
Inverted flight is difficult, so you'd have your back facing her, too.
【Misaki】
...Hold up. This is all she has to do to counter me?
【Masaya】
Yeah, probably.
Misaki looks dumbfounded.
【Misaki】
Why's no one ever done this before? It's so simple.
【Masaya】
Because everyone's fixated on the idea that dogfights are all about continuous flight, and flying as fast as possible.
【Misaki】
Well, yeah?
【Masaya】
Don't give me that. You're the one who's been calling it a simple strategy.
【Misaki】
Ah...
【Masaya】
Both students and teachers are under the same impression. No one questions it.
【Misaki】
But why does no one question it?
【Masaya】
Because FC dogfights are based on actual warplanes.
【Misaki】
Really?
【Masaya】
When two airplanes engage in battle, that's called a dogfight. FC adopted that as a part of the sport, turning them into Continuous Flight Dogfights.
【Misaki】
What's up with the continuous flight bit?
【Masaya】
It's because, unlike helicopters, planes can't come to a stop in the air... FC has a pretty short history, so it's easy to research, and if you do you'll see that they used to award points based on touching your opponent anywhere.
【Misaki】
Oh, really? Wouldn't that make Fighters super overpowered?
【Masaya】
Totally. That's why they limited it to only scoring when you touch your opponent's back. Otherwise, Fighters would just stop moving and start throwing jabs at each other from the front.
Misaki shuts her eyes and imagines it.
【Misaki】
Oh, I get it. Then it would turn into some kind of combat sport like boxing or wrestling.
【Masaya】
Apparently that's what ended up happening. The whole point of the sport is that flying is fun, so just coming to a stop and having a fistfight in the air ruins it. That's why they amended the rules.
【Misaki】
But why only the back?
【Masaya】
Because the players have to try and circle around each other to score. That makes the flying more intense and exciting to watch.
【Misaki】
Makes sense.
【Masaya】
The current ruleset was designed to make as much of a show out of flying as possible. Since it's recommended to everyone, they all take it as the <i>correct</i> way to fly.
【Misaki】
So what you're saying is that Inui-san's exploiting a loophole in the rules?
【Masaya】
She's just doing everything she can to win. As long as she's not breaking any rules, no one can criticize her.
【Misaki】
I guess, but I can't say I'm happy about it. You think they'll change the rules if her strategy gets popular?
【Masaya】
They might. But it won't happen before we graduate, and there are a lot of people who wouldn't want the rules changed anyway.
【Misaki】
There are?
【Masaya】
Asuka loved seeing Inui in action.
【Misaki】
......
Misaki smiles glumly.
【Misaki】
Right... Asuka, duh.
【Masaya】
Anyway, back to the practice session.
【Misaki】
Roger! Um, I can't challenge her to a dogfight from below, so I take a large detour and aim to get above her...
That's the strategy that Shindou-san tried.
It's the first thing anyone would think of in that situation.
【Masaya】
It's difficult to look above you while you're flying at full speed, right?
【Misaki】
Huh? Yeah, it is.
Her chest would be facing the water, meaning she'd have to twist her entire body to see above her.
【Masaya】
But Inui can see you perfectly from her position.
【Misaki】
That's why I have a second to relay that information.
【Masaya】
Obviously I would, but I'm sure you realize that hearing information about someone's position is different from actually being able to see them.
【Misaki】
Yeah.
【Masaya】
So, Inui, who has the height advantage, comes down from above and attempts to touch your head.
【Misaki】
Ugh! Then I descend into a Low Yo-Yo.
【Masaya】
Inui doesn't follow. Instead, she just slowly closes the gap between you.
【Misaki】
Well, I make some distance between us.
【Masaya】
She allows you to do so for a moment before chasing after you.
【Misaki】
I'll just run further away! Huh? What the hell?!
Misaki's ended up crouching down, her Mr. Shitou practically rubbing against the floor.
【Misaki】
I've run out of airspace, just like what happened to Ichinose-chan in my match with her, but with the positions reversed.
【Masaya】
Now, just like her, you can only move horizontally.
【Misaki】
Ughhh!
【Masaya】
You getting Ichinose into that position was just a result of your actions, but Inui calculated this.
【Misaki】
...I see.
【Masaya】
So, what'll you do now?
【Misaki】
She's already taken a point, so I don't wanna jump to the next line.
If she did, she'd be giving Inui free access to third, making it 2:0.
【Misaki】
I'll move to the side of the second to get myself some space.
【Masaya】
While you're doing that, Inui starts aiming straight for third.
【Misaki】
Huuuh? W-Wait! I give chase!
【Masaya】
You can't catch her. Inui touches the third, so the score's 2:0. She uses the recoil to accelerate.
【Misaki】
Wait, so no matter what, I have to work from two points down?
【Masaya】
Yep.
【Misaki】
I have to do everything over again while two points down... Oh, I see now... This is how Shindou-san lost.
Misaki nods. Seems she finally understands.
【Masaya】
Exactly.
【Misaki】
There's no way I can win.
【Masaya】
No, there isn't. But it has nothing to do with your dogfighting technique. It's simply a matter of whether you know the strategy or not.
【Misaki】
...And Asuka finds this fun.
【Masaya】
Apparently, yeah.
【Misaki】
Hahahaha... Impressive. I swear, that girl's insane.
【Masaya】
How will you break out of this situation?
【Misaki】
Well, um... You have an idea, right, Masaya? Can't you just tell me instead of making me think about it?
【Masaya】
I don't have a clue.
【Misaki】
You serious?
【Masaya】
Sure am. So try and think about it.
Misaki rocks her Mr. Shitou left and right as she ponders.
【Misaki】
If I fly like this, then do this, and this, like this... Um... Grrrrrrrrrrrr!
After a long while of trying, Misaki suddenly holds Mr. Shitou above her head.
【Misaki】
And then, Mr. Shitou goes vrooooooooom!
She throws him at the wall.
【Masaya】
Hey!
【Misaki】
Mr. Shitou exceeded the speed of light! He's at Mach speed!
【Masaya】
The speed of light is incomparably faster than Mach speed. You do realize that, right?
【Misaki】
Your tricks are worthless in the face of my Mach light speed flying!
【Masaya】
Take this seriously!
What the hell is Mach light speed, anyway?! Some new unit of measurement?
【Misaki】
I was taking this seriously. All that thinking made my head explode, which made my impulses take over, letting Mr. Shitou cross the light speed barrier.
【Masaya】
Pretty cruel to throw an extension of yourself into a wall.
【Misaki】
Oh yeah! I transferred my soul into him...
【Misaki】
Hey, hold it. What about what I just did?
【Masaya】
What about it?
【Misaki】
Why don't I just use speed to overtake her?
【Masaya】
Yeah, I considered that myself...
Misaki shrugs her shoulders.
【Misaki】
What, you don't think it'll work?
【Masaya】
It might, if you were playing Asuka. It wouldn't work on Inui.
【Misaki】
Purrdon me?
【Masaya】
Inui managed to beat Prez in a contest of speed.
【Misaki】
Oh, yeah, that <i>did</i> happen. I wouldn't have any chance in a speed showdown.
【Masaya】
She is a Speeder, after all.
Those unfamiliar Grav Shoes Inui was wearing briefly come to mind. I wonder how they were tuned...
【Misaki】
Um, so you mean this is a strategy she keeps in reserve for when she can't win with speed?
【Masaya】
Probably. She tried racing Shindou-san when their match first started, but she soon gave up and switched to this tactic.
【Misaki】
Hm...
【Masaya】
Let's keep going. It's easier to understand when you're actually moving Mr. Shitou around.
【Misaki】
Aight, let's do this.
Before long, Misaki actually ended up putting in the effort required to enjoy our simulated Mr. Shitou session.
We come to a stop in front of the gate.
The sweet smell of soy sauce is wafting over from what I guess you'd describe as the main residence.
【Misaki】
Hahahaha, that smell is kinda embarrassing. I do love it, though.
Yep, smells like home cooking alright. Though I do get why she finds a guy smelling this at her place embarrassing.
【Masaya】
Smells delicious, whatever it is.
【Misaki】
Well, that's nice... Wanna join us for dinner some time?
【Masaya】
If I get the chance.
【Misaki】
Fair enough, it <i>would</i> be embarrassing.
【Masaya】
Yeah, and explaining everything would be a pain.
Her grandma would <i>definitely</i> ask if I'm her boyfriend.
【Misaki】
Want me to walk you home?
【Masaya】
Guys walk girls home because it's not safe for them to be walking around alone at night. It'd be weird if you took me home now.
【Misaki】
But I've never heard of any creepy pervs hanging around this area.
【Masaya】
Seriously, it's fine. You don't need to worry.
【Misaki】
You sure?
【Masaya】
Yeah. We'll see each other tomorrow anyway.
【Misaki】
R-Right...
【Masaya】
Later.
【Misaki】
W-Wait a minute!
She hurriedly grabs hold of my sleeve.
【Masaya】
What's up?
【Misaki】
Um, we're gonna be at the beach again tomorrow, yeah?
【Masaya】
Yep.
【Misaki】
So, um...
【Masaya】
Yeah?
【Misaki】
I'm gonna work real hard tomorrow!
【Masaya】
Y-You are?!
【Misaki】
It's just...
It's at this point she realizes she's still holding my sleeve and quickly lets go.
【Misaki】
Y'know, like... I say a lot of things that make it sound like I'm not motivated, but I am really... So, yeah...
【Masaya】
I get it.
【Misaki】
Good. See you tomorrow, then.
【Masaya】
Good night.
We wave at each other as I walk off.
【Masaya】
Come on, this is the home stretch! Get those thighs up higher! Don't quit on me now! I wanna see the sand getting kicked up behind you!
【Misaki】
I've got this!
【Masaya】
This is it! Give it everything you've got! Squeeze out that last bit of juice!
【Misaki】
Meoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!
Misaki crosses the finish line marked out on the sand.
【Misaki】
Ughhh! Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah...
She holds her wrist out as she pants for breath.
【Masaya】
......
I check her pulse.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah...
【Masaya】
...It's time.
【Misaki】
Mmm, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah... Mmm... Time for what?
【Masaya】
You can fly now.
【Misaki】
Ah...!
Misaki grabs the bottle that we'd stuck in the sand earlier.
【Misaki】
Mgh, mmm, mgh, mmm, haaah!
After gulping down some water she says...
【Misaki】
Really?!
【Masaya】
Would I lie to you about this?
Misaki grabs hold of her tummy, as if she has a sudden stomachache.
【Misaki】
Nghhhhhhhhh!
【Masaya】
Wh-What's wrong?
She suddenly leaps into the air like she'd been a heavily compressed spring.
【Misaki】
YEEEEEES! IT'S TIME! I CAN FLY! I'M FINALLY GONNA FLY!
【Masaya】
Y-You're really pumped about this, huh?
In her excitement, she slaps me on the chest.
【Misaki】
Yeah, of course I'm pumped! Hehehe, I was starting to feel like a dog who's told to sit while food's dangled in front of him. I kinda started thinking you were into some kinky roleplay, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Don't call this roleplay.
I pull my phone out of my pocket.
【Misaki】
Huh, what're you doing? Phoning someone to tell them how happy I am about flying?
【Masaya】
Something like that. You need someone to practice against. Otherwise, we'll be stuck doing the basics. That's why I'm calling in some help.
【Misaki】
Who?
【Shion】
Hahahahaha! So the day has finally come!
There's a booming laugh as Prez strikes a pose before heading this way.
【Misaki】
P-Prez? Masaya, you called <i>him?</i>
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Shion】
I've been trembling with anticipation as I waited for this call!
【Masaya】
Thanks for coming.
【Shion】
I hear that our club's been split in two!
【Masaya】
I'm sorry. I ruined everything you worked so hard to create.
【Shion】
There's no need to apologize! Creating strife in the calmest of places is what makes you a man! I loved having a complete club, but having a divided one is just as amazing!
【Masaya】
Doesn't really seem like that to me...
I'm sure he'd be happier if we all stuck together.
But he's doing his best not to act all depressed... I feel so guilty.
【Shion】
You better do this right.
【Masaya】
Yes, I will.
What else can I say?
【Masaya】
The two sides of our club aren't fighting, at least.
【Shion】
You split our club in two without causing a fight? What a true man! But anyway!
Prez turns to face Misaki and puffs out his chest with pride.
【Shion】
You can relax now, I'm here.
【Misaki】
Th-Thank y--
【Shirase】
Hey now, Misaki-chan! Aoyagi-kun's not the only one joining you!
【Misaki】
Huh?!
Shirase-san snuck up behind us.
【Misaki】
Shirase-san too?!
【Shirase】
Hahahaha! Hayato Shirase, owner of Shirase Sky Sports, at your service!
【Shion】
Hahahahahahaha!
【Shirase】
Hahahahahahaha!
【Misaki】
......
Prez and Shirase-san draw close to each other.
【Shirase】
Aoyagi-kun... I see you've been working out.
【Shion】
Lately, I've been building up my adductor muscles.
【Shirase】
Hehehe... Good, very good.
Shirase-san starts stroking Prez's inner thighs.
【Shion】
Mmm...
【Shirase】
Nice... Such tender muscles. Mmm, very nice. I should try this myself.
【Misaki】
......
Misaki turns to glare at me.
【Misaki】
You trying to tell me to join their freaky muscle world?
【Masaya】
Don't be so mean.
【Shion】
Join us, Tobisawa!
【Shirase】
Hehehe, you won't believe how fun it is.
The two of them beckon to Misaki.
【Misaki】
I-I'll never join you! Are you trying to sacrifice me or something?! Is that your kink?
【Masaya】
What is it with you and kinks today? Anyway, they're not looking for a sacrifice.
【Shirase】
I'd more than welcome a cute girl as a sacrifice.
【Misaki】
That's sexual harassment!
【Masaya】
It's definitely creepy, at the very least.
【Shion】
Or you, Hinata. Your sacrifice is welcome!
【Masaya】
Please, no.
Misaki pulls on the hem of my shirt.
【Misaki】
I appreciate you getting training partners for me, but why these two of all--
【Shirase】
Wait a moment! Aoyagi-kun and I aren't the only ones here to help.
【Misaki】
Someone else from Planet Brawn?
【Shirase】
No, not our third member. Look behind you!
【Misaki】
Behind me-- Aaah!
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahahahahahahahaha!
Up in the skies, behind Misaki, is a Skywalker wearing a mask.
【Misaki】
M-Masked Skywalker! The Mysterious Masked Skywalker! The totally weak, utterly devoid of strategy, Mysterious Masked Skywalker!
【Masaya】
Don't be so rude to your practice partner.
【Misaki】
What?! I'm gonna practice with the freak in the mask?
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Masked Skywalker turns their back to us, puts their hands on their hips, and laughs like some kind of supervillain.
Then, they descend next to Shirase-san.
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahahaha! The Mysterious Masked Skywalker has arrived!
Misaki looks perplexed.
【Misaki】
There's, um... something weird about your voice. Like, it doesn't really fit your appearance... if you know what I mean?
【Masked Skywalker】
P-Preposterous!
【Shirase】
R-Right. They're definitely n-not using a voice modulator or anything!
【Masaya】
Why are you panicking, Shirase-san?
His eyes dart around.
【Shirase】
I'm not. What would I even panic about?!
【Masked Skywalker】
Regardless, the mask has no gender!
【Misaki】
They refer to themselves as "the mask"! That's kinda cool!
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahahahaha! To the gallows with you!
【Misaki】
I'm being given the death penalty? Are you one of those people who doesn't actually follow a conversation?
【Shirase】
Hahahahahaha!
【Shion】
Hahahahahaha!
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahahaha!
Misaki looks them up and down, one by one.
【Misaki】
God! This is more nauseating than drinking an entire gallon of oil! Seriously, what the hell is this?
【Masaya】
The Misaki Comeback Project, created in secret on the dark web.
【Misaki】
Masaya, your phone's connected to the dark web?! I've never met anyone so trustworthy!
She's clearly being sarcastic.
【Masaya】
Project Member Number 1, Masaya Hinata!
【Shion】
Project Member Number 2, Shion Aoyagi!
【Shirase】
Project Member Number 3, Hayato Shirase!
【Masked Skywalker】
Project Member Number 4, The Mysterious Masked Skywalker!
【Misaki】
The Mysterious Masked Skywalker is your full name?!
Masked Skywalker points at Misaki with a snap.
【Masked Skywalker】
I shall defeat you!
【Misaki】
Huh? First it was the death penalty, now this? Why're you so eager to pick a fight?
【Masaya】
Did you do something to them?
【Misaki】
Of course not. I only saw them play in the summer tournament. We've never even spoken. We're not even connected at all.
【Masked Skywalker】
Hehehe, the mask isn't so sure about that.
【Misaki】
Huh?
【Masked Skywalker】
Allow yourself to toss and turn at night as you ponder the true nature of the mask!
【Misaki】
Are you really worth losing sleep over? Wait, are you someone I know? Is it you, Mashiro?
【Masked Skywalker】
Mashiro? Who's that?
【Misaki】
......
Misaki stumbles a little at Masked Skywalker's nonchalant answer.
【Masked Skywalker】
The true nature of the Mysterious Masked Skywalker shall never be revealed.
【Shion】
If a Dark Skywalker's true identity comes to light, the shady organizations who run it reserve the right to have them eliminated.
【Misaki】
So our Mysterious Masked Skywalker is a Dark Skywalker now?
【Masked Skywalker】
Hehehehehe...
【Masaya】
Well, all that aside...
【Misaki】
We're really just ignoring that?
【Masaya】
We are.
Dark Skywalkers don't exist... I think.
【Masaya】
I explained what was going on to Shirase-san a few days ago, and when he heard that you needed practice partners, he invited Masked Skywalker to join us.
【Shirase】
The Mysterious Masked Skywalker is the only FC player Kamidorisha Academy has.
【Shion】
Hm? Then what do they do about a second?
【Masaya】
The rules say your second can be a student at another school.
【Shion】
Oh, I think I've seen that happen before.
【Shirase】
So, as luck would have it, I was asked to manage the Kamidorisha FC Club, and I was on the lookout for some practice partners myself.
【Masked Skywalker】
This is not practice. I've come to defeat you fools! To the gallows with you!
【Misaki】
Oh, yes. L-Looking forward to playing against you.
Misaki bows and gives a completely out-of-place reply, presumably overwhelmed by Masked Skywalker's personality.
Man, she kinda just said she was looking forward to being killed, huh?
【Masaya】
I was thinking we'd start with some light warm up exercises, then practicing with Prez. If that's okay with you, of course, Prez?
【Shion】
Sure thing! I can't wait to show you the results of my 24/7 muscle training program!
【Masaya】
I was under the impression the summer break was a really important time for seniors...
He's totally gonna flunk his university entrance exams.
【Misaki】
U-Um...!
【Shion】
Yeah, what's up?
Misaki bows to Prez.
【Misaki】
Thank you for coming here to help me.
【Shion】
Oh! Don't sweat it!
Prez grins.
【Shion】
I wanted to see you taking things seriously.
【Misaki】
I'll do my best.
【Masaya】
Allow me to explain the purpose of our practice sessions. Our aim is to allow you to counter Inui, even if you can't reach the same level of play as her. This will largely come down to technique.
【Misaki】
Inui-san's the goal, huh?
【Masaya】
I imagine this is also Asuka's intention.
【Misaki】
......
【Masaya】
If you can't counter her, you'll just get crushed. But if you can counter her, you'll get the chance to make use of all the techniques you've learned.
【Misaki】
So, in other words, if I can't counter her, all of this is a waste?
【Masaya】
Yep.
【Misaki】
Okay, but why does forming a plan against Inui-san have me practicing with Prez?
【Masaya】
Out of all the regional and national matches Inui's participated in, Prez gave her the closest match. If we want you to be able to play effectively against her, we need to come up with a way to stop her. That's why you need to practice with someone who can fly on her level.
【Misaki】
But, um...
【Masaya】
I know. You've practiced a lot with him in the past, so you know what to expect, right?
She can probably read him like a book at this point, meaning it won't be hard for her to stop him.
【Masaya】
That's why we're not doing normal practice. Prez will take to the field first and do two or three laps to build up speed before you enter.
【Misaki】
I get it.
【Masaya】
Also, my headset will be connected to Prez, but not to you. You'll have to use your own judgments up there.
【Misaki】
This is part of the FC head training too, huh?
【Masaya】
Exactly. Don't forget, you need to make decisions with the entire match in mind, not just the current situation.
【Misaki】
Got anything more concrete?
【Masaya】
One example is deciding where to jump to after you're overtaken. Prez flies fast, so there'll be times where your best option is to skip two lines ahead instead of just one.
【Misaki】
Oh, I see. You've always been the one instructing me on this stuff, so I've never had to think about it.
【Masaya】
Try thinking about a bunch of things today.
【Misaki】
Thinking, huh...?
【Masaya】
Right, let's get started. It's been a while since you last flew, so we'll start with ten minutes of field flying.
【Misaki】
Okay! Ready furr liftoff!
Misaki flies up toward the field.
【Shion】
Take this!
【Misaki】
Aaah! Nghhh!
I knew this would happen.
Prez is having a field day up there.
【Shirase】
Aoyagi-kun seems to have learned a thing or two from the summer tournament. His movements are great. How can I put this, it's like he's not fixated on his form, but in a good way.
【Masaya】
Yeah.
All Prez ever cared about was flying as fast as possible, which made his feints awkward.
He also had a habit of making wide stretching movements to prevent a loss of speed while overtaking someone, so it almost felt like he was reluctant to do so.
But now...
【Shirase】
He's actually throwing feints in there.
They're only simple feints, pretending to go one way before going the other. Hell, he's only really using his head and his eyes to make them.
And yet...
【Misaki】
Nghhh!
It's enough to make Misaki groan in frustration as she gets passed again and again.
As simple as his moves are, his sheer speed leaves her unable to counter him.
If he'd mastered this style earlier, he might have gotten pretty far in the summer tournament.
【Shirase】
Misaki-chan keeps on getting passed.
【Masaya】
That's what happens when you go a while without flying.
It doesn't help that I told her to think things through while flying.
I doubt she's ever done that before, so her mind and body will be totally out of sync.
【Shirase】
...You know, I'm a little surprised.
【Masaya】
About what?
【Shirase】
That you decided to support Misaki-chan instead of Asuka-chan.
【Masaya】
Support, huh?
【Shirase】
That's what you're doing, right? Mind if I ask what your reason is?
I can feel emotion behind Shirase-san's words as he continues to look up at the sky.
【Shirase】
...You like dark hair and big tits, huh?
【Masaya】
No!
【Shirase】
That's not it?
【Masaya】
Obviously not! I don't know if you'll be able to understand my reason...
【Shirase】
Try me.
【Masaya】
Misaki is me. If she can't fly, then neither can I.
【Shirase】
......
【Masaya】
That's why I'm supporting her.
Shirase-san drags in air like he's smoking a cigarette.
【Shirase】
Sounds like an unhealthy relationship to me.
【Masked Skywalker】
Yes, completely unhealthy!
Masked Skywalker suddenly interjects.
【Masked Skywalker】
You should free yourself from that woman at once.
【Masaya】
Uh, come again?
【Masked Skywalker】
That woman has an air of misfortune about her!
【Masaya】
If you say so...?
Shirase-san grins.
【Shirase】
I can see your relationship heading toward a bad end.
【Masaya】
No one asked for your opinion.
【Shirase】
I'm being serious here. You think she can win the fall tournament?
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahahaha! Release yourself from her and dedicate yourself to coaching the mask!
【Masaya】
Why are you so worked up about this, Mask? I don't care about tournaments or any of that crap.
【Shirase】
That's an interesting statement. I thought we gathered here to work for Misaki-chan's future?
【Masaya】
Yeah, I am doing this for her future.
I look up at the field.
Misaki's movements are sluggish. She's unable to keep up with Prez's speed in the slightest.
Looks like she's really trying to follow my instructions and use her head while flying.
Her reactions are coming in moments too slow, but that's to be expected when she's trying to think things through.
【Masaya】
But that's not my main motivation.
【Masked Skywalker】
You make no sense!
【Shirase】
Hahahahaha, come on, let's hear him out.
【Masaya】
I'm doing this because I want to. Maybe it'll end as badly as you suggest, Shirase-san... but that doesn't change the fact that I have to do this.
【Masked Player/Shirase】
......
【Shirase】
......
【Masked Skywalker】
......
【Masaya】
Um, like... I guess what I'm trying to say is, it doesn't matter how things end up, I just know that not doing anything would leave me far more miserable.
【Shirase】
Hm, this whole thing's lit a fire under your ass, huh?
【Masaya】
I'd prefer it if that were the case.
I truly mean that. If the fire was already lit, then I'd be running hot right now.
Somebody, seriously, light that fire for me.
【Masaya】
Right now, Misaki and I are just smoldering, letting off clouds of black smoke. If we don't get ourselves fired up... I don't think we'll ever get anywhere.
Shirase-san smiles with what seems like both exasperation and admiration.
【Shirase】
You're making me want to help out more and more. As I said before, I prefer more eccentric people.
【Masked Skywalker】
......
【Shirase】
Though all I can really offer you is advice. If I went up there, it could have an effect on my bottom line, you see.
【Masaya】
Why's that?
【Shirase】
If people start thinking I'm giving Kunahama students preferential treatment, they might stop coming to my store.
【Masaya】
Your advice is more than good enough for me.
【Masked Skywalker】
Sounds to me like you're forcing yourself to suffer in order to coach that woman. You should part from her at once!
【Masaya】
Um, you keep saying that. Like... did you even listen to me?
【Masked Skywalker】
Part from her and coach the mask!
【Masaya】
Yeah, no, I heard you the first time, but... the only one I can coach right now is Misaki.
【Masked Skywalker】
Grrrrrr!
【Shirase】
Well, he isn't lying to us, so let's just help him out for now. These practice sessions will help you improve too, Mask.
【Masked Skywalker】
Grrrrrr!
【Masaya】
I'd really appreciate the help.
【Masked Skywalker】
...Very well. If you insist.
【Masaya】
Thanks.
I don't know anything about Masked Skywalker, but if Shirase-san's friends with them, they can't be a bad person.
Now then.
Prez is flying circles around Misaki up on the field. I've never seen anything quite like it.
I switch on my headset.
【Masaya】
Prez, come back down. Practice is over.
【Shion】
Okay.
He points at the ground, signaling to Misaki that it's time to descend.
【Misaki】
......
Misaki gives a small nod and follows him.
Prez turns off his Grav Shoes and strikes a bodybuilder pose as he lands.
【Shion】
I'm in perfect form!
【Misaki】
Using my head makes my reaction times slower.
【Masaya】
That's how it'll be at first. The more you practice, the less of a gap there'll be between your mind and your body.
【Misaki】
You think?
【Masaya】
The idea is to get your thoughts and your feelings in sync. Right now you feel, but you don't think.
【Misaki】
You're making me sound like an idiot.
【Masaya】
Right, time to get prepared for the next practice session.
【Shirase】
My time has finally come!
Shirase-san takes out a laptop.
【Shirase】
Mind if I have a play with your Grav Shoes, Misaki-chan?
【Misaki】
Huh? As long as Masaya says it's fine...
She glances over at me.
【Masaya】
Really, I should be the one modifying them, but it's more practical to get Shirase-san to do it. He's way faster. If you don't mind, Shirase-san?
【Shirase】
You bet. You can keep them on. Just hold still for me.
【Misaki】
Okay.
Shirase-san connects his laptop to Misaki's Grav Shoes.
【Misaki】
So how're you modifying them?
【Masaya】
I'm gonna change your initial velocity to that of a Speeder's while keeping your acceleration the same as it is, a Fighter's.
【Misaki】
...Hm? But there's like, no upside to that.
【Masaya】
Nope, there isn't. But that's what we want.
【Misaki】
Why?
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahaha. Yet the mask's Grav Shoes will not be altered. You shall falter under the overwhelming difference in our abilities!
【Misaki】
Think it's gonna come down to the difference in our Grav Shoes, if anything...
【Masked Skywalker】
To the gallows with you!
【Misaki】
Oh, okay. Don't mind if I do.
【Masaya】
You really should mind that.
【Misaki】
Oh, um... It's just, the Mysterious Masked Skywalker doesn't seem like a bad person, so I feel bad about saying no to them.
I can't quite put my finger on why, but I don't think they're evil either. If anything, they're sort of heroic, even if they're forcing the act a bit too hard.
【Masaya】
Okay, allow me to explain the purpose of this practice session. This time, Mask will be imitating Inui's tactics. We'll have you flying slowly so that you can focus on seeing how you move.
【Misaki】
And flying slowly will give me more time to think, right?
【Masaya】
Exactly. We also need you to observe how Mask moves at the same time. If you were just flying normally, you'd never take the information in, right?
【Misaki】
But, um... Well, is Mask gonna be able to fly the same as Inui-san?
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahahaha!
【Shirase】
You don't need to worry about that. I'll be the Mysterious Masked Skywalker's second. I can instruct them on exactly how to fly.
【Masaya】
I'll be your second, Misaki, but I want you to focus on thinking for yourself as you fly.
【Misaki】
Roger.
【Shirase】
Sweet, finished tuning your Grav Shoes just in time.
【Misaki】
Okay. I'm looking forward to this, Mask.
【Masked Skywalker】
I shall render you incapable of speech!
【Misaki】
Oh, okay. I'm looking forward to it.
Misaki courteously bows.
【Misaki】
Okay, ready furr lift off...! God, I feel so heavy!
She wobbles as she ascends into the sky.
【Misaki】
I can't accelerate at all.
【Shirase】
Did I go too far?
【Masaya】
This is fine for now. We can bump things up slowly as we practice.
【Misaki】
Huuuh? I feel like I've lost half my muscles.
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahaha! Yet the mask is the same as always!
【Masaya】
Okay, if you could start above, Mask, and you below, Misaki.
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahaha!
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah... Ugh, no matter how many times I start over, I always end up pressed right against the water.
【Masaya】
Don't sweat it, that's only natural. Regain your positioning and take it from the top, one more time.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haah, haaah... It's so much pressure being below the whole time. I-I'm exhausted...
Her opponent has the advantageous position at all times, so she can't let up for a second.
【Shirase】
Man, now that we're actually trying this out, I see how insane Inui's tactics are. We can't use any of the countermeasures we normally use.
【Masaya】
True, but this should help us to build a strategy and open a path forward.
【Shirase】
Open a path forward, huh? How do you plan on doing that?
【Masaya】
If Misaki can keep even with Inui in the positioning battles, she can use her dogfight skills to pull out a win.
【Shirase】
Yeah, that sounds feasible. The issue is how you go about doing it.
【Masaya】
...Yeah.
How we go about doing it? Well...
There are three options. Which ones should I push Misaki to choose?
I'm not sure yet.
【Misaki】
Ahhh!
【Masaya】
Good work. You must be tired.
【Misaki】
I dunno. Your brain must be more tired than me.
We gathered together after practice to talk about our future plans.
Not just scheduling, but details about how we'll counter Inui and the like too. It took so long that it's gotten dark out.
【Masaya】
We <i>did</i> have a lot to discuss.
【Misaki】
Yeah.
【Masaya】
In the end, I think there are three major strategies you can use to beat Inui.
【Misaki】
What the hell?! You already have an answer, but you made me think anyway?! Wow, what a bully!
【Masaya】
You're the one who has the ultimate decision on what we do, Misaki. That's why I needed you to understand Inui's playstyle.
【Misaki】
Fine. So?
【Masaya】
The first option is to go all in on becoming a Speeder.
【Misaki】
You mean become like Prez?
【Masaya】
Exactly. You'd use your speed to take the lead right from the start and never let up.
【Misaki】
But what if Inui-san jumps to the next line and tries to stop me?
【Masaya】
You'd be at a disadvantage if she managed to stop you, but I imagine Inui will start the match by challenging you to a contest of speed. If you can get off to a good start and just keep going, you could pull it off.
【Misaki】
I see. What's next?
【Masaya】
Go all in on becoming a Fighter. The kind of player who can win a dogfight no matter their positioning.
【Misaki】
You mean even if my opponent's keeping the height advantage?
【Masaya】
Exactly. I think it's possible. Inui's tactics revolve around putting up a wall her opponent can't get past.
【Misaki】
So I'd have to be such a strong Fighter that I could break through a wall.
【Masaya】
Exactly. I think that's the option Asuka will pick.
【Misaki】
Why?
【Masaya】
Asuka's good at Airkick Turns, right? That means she's already good at techniques that take advantage of the membrane's features. I doubt it'll be long before she can pull off a Cobra and other high level moves.
【Misaki】
...I can't use any moves that take advantage of the membrane.
【Masaya】
It's tough unless you can sense anti-gravitons with your skin. Though there are other techniques we can use.
【Misaki】
So why do you think Asuka will opt for being a Fighter?
【Masaya】
Because being able to pull off nonstandard tactics like consecutive Airturn Kicks will probably confuse Inui enough to be able to steal the height advantage from her.
【Misaki】
Makes sense. And the last option?
【Masaya】
Become like Inui.
【Misaki】
Uh, how?
【Masaya】
Employ the strategy of keeping the height advantage.
【Misaki】
But only one of us can be on top at a time?
【Masaya】
Yeah, so if you lose it, you either move over to the next line or try to get back on top from below. Though I'm still not exactly sure how you'd do that.
【Misaki】
You think Inui-san knows a way to get back on top?
【Masaya】
Wouldn't surprise me.
【Misaki】
Yeah.
【Masaya】
I think you need to pick one of the three options sooner rather than later.
【Misaki】
Well, being a Speeder is out.
【Masaya】
You never know, you might surprise yourself.
Back when we first met, she ended up flying even more beautifully than me.
Misaki shakes her head, however.
【Misaki】
I don't think being a Speeder suits my personality.
【Masaya】
So you'll take the Fighter route, then?
Misaki shakes her head again.
【Misaki】
I'm gonna aim to copy Inui-san's style. I think that's the most realistic approach.
【Masaya】
Okay.
It's hard to see how Misaki could become the kind of Fighter or Speeder she'd need to be to best Inui. They don't exist yet.
However, Inui does exist. There's a basis to work from.
【Misaki】
Feels a bit unfair to try and win by copying her, but desperate times call for desperate measures.
【Masaya】
Mhm...
【Misaki】
I know it's taken some time, but... I've finally made up my mind.
【Masaya】
Good.
【Misaki】
So, like...
【Masaya】
Hm?
Misaki takes half a step closer to me.
【Misaki】
......
She's now slightly too close for a normal conversation.
【Masaya】
What's up?
【Misaki】
I really like you, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Huh? Huuuh?!
【Misaki】
I really like you, Masaya. How do you feel about me?
【Masaya】
Hold on! Like, you just said, but this doesn't... Like, how did you end up, that's not where the conversation--
【Misaki】
Don't sweat the small stuff. I've made up my mind, so now it's your turn. Otherwise, it's no fair.
【Masaya】
Shit!
【Misaki】
Shit? You're gonna swear after a girl confesses to you?
【Masaya】
Quit trying to pick a fight. I wanted to be the first to say it.
【Misaki】
Oh, you were thinking the same thing as me?
【Masaya】
I was. I recently realized how much I like you, Misaki.
Misaki flusters and awkwardly nods.
【Misaki】
O-Okay. I-I thought I m-might have been wrong. S-So, um, now I know I wasn't... I'm, uh... confused! I'm confused! Confused, I tell you!
【Masaya】
Yeah, now you're getting me confused too.
【Misaki】
D-Did you realize that I liked you too, Masaya?
【Masaya】
I think so... but I wasn't sure.
【Misaki】
You can lie, just try not to sound so vague.
【Masaya】
I knew.
【Misaki】
...G-Good.
【Masaya】
Wh-What do you mean, good?
Misaki lets out a little laugh, face as stiff as a board.
【Misaki】
Like, it's good. I'll forgive you. We'll forget I ever said anything. You can say it first now. Hahahahahaha!
【Masaya】
Okay, here goes nothing.
【Misaki】
R-Right.
【Masaya】
Um... Misaki, I--
【Misaki】
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
【Masaya】
Why're you laughing?!
【Misaki】
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Knowing that you're about to ask me out h-has me so nervous I can't stop myself. Haha! Hahahahahahaha!
【Masaya】
You're making this <i>really</i> hard!
【Misaki】
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha! I-It's not like I'm doing this on purpose.
【Masaya】
......
I grab hold of Misaki's arms.
【Misaki】
......
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
My heart skipped a beat the moment you touched me. I can hear it pounding in my chest. Feels like i-it's about to explode.
【Masaya】
I'm in the same boat.
【Misaki】
Your hands are so warm, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Your arms are warm too, Misaki.
【Misaki】
Which ones are warmer?
【Masaya】
They're about the same... A-Anyway!
【Misaki】
Y-Yesh!
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
......
We look each other right in the eyes. Hers are clouded over, pulling me in toward them with no hopes of escaping.
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
......
Time continues to flow as we just stand there, eyes locked.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah!
Misaki's breathing has grown ragged.
【Misaki】
Ah!
She's trembling slightly.
【Masaya】
You okay?
【Misaki】
I-I'm so nervous i-it feels like my legs are about to give out... It'd really help i-if you could hurry it up.
【Masaya】
Okay...
My throat is dry, the words stuck right at the back of it.
I force myself to swallow my saliva.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah!
【Masaya】
I really like you, Misaki. Will you go out with me?
【Misaki】
Y-Yesh... R-Roger.
【Masaya】
I'm gonna kiss you.
【Misaki】
Huuuh?!
Misaki suddenly tenses up even harder.
【Masaya】
I'm gonna kiss you.
【Misaki】
O-Okay... Oh, no!
【Masaya】
I'm kissing you.
【Misaki】
I-I just told you not too! Haaah, haaah, haaah... I'm out of breath, so I have to breathe through my mouth. If you kiss me now, I'll suffocate.
【Masaya】
I've never heard of anyone suffocating from a kiss before.
【Misaki】
B-But... Haaah, haaah, haaah... Can you really kiss while breathing through your mouth?
【Masaya】
Not sure... but I think you can.
【Misaki】
O-Okay. In that case... I'm ready, haaah, haaah, haaah! Kiss... Aaah!
【Masaya】
Wh-Why'd you scream?!
【Misaki】
My heart skipped a beat again when I said kiss. Haaah, ngh, haaah, haaah, haaah, my heart's... gonna explode...
Misaki leans forward like someone's pulling on her head.
【Misaki】
I-I'm ready!
I lean in as well.
【Masaya】
Mmmph!
Our lips touch, and in that instant hers seem to pucker up a little.
【Misaki】
Mmm, mmm! Mmmph, mmmph, mmm, mmmph!
Misaki's breathing hard through her nose.
【Masaya】
Mmmph, mmm!
I move my lips ever so slightly.
【Misaki】
Mmmph!
My heart skips a beat.
Her lips are so soft...
The way they're pressed up against mine feels so good.
【Misaki】
Mmmph, mmm, mmm!
Kissing feels amazing.
You always hear people say that, but I thought they just meant on an emotional level.
But that's not it at all. There's a certain emotional part to it, sure, but...
I didn't know that simply having someone else's lips against your own could feel good on a physical level. No one ever told me.
That's why I'm completely taken aback.
I can clearly feel how her lips are trembling ever so slightly.
I want more... What will happen if we keep going?
Just trying to imagine it makes the back of my head feel ready to melt.
What am I doing, imagining kissing while I'm already kissing?
I can't believe I want her this badly.
I take both my lips to Misaki's top lip...
【Misaki】
Mmmmmmmmm!
And then, I hold it between them.
【Misaki】
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!
Every time I covet in her lips...
【Misaki】
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm!
Misaki struggles for breath.
It's all kind of sexual. Hard to believe kissing alone can get us like this...
Unable to take it any longer, I finally lean away.
【Masaya】
Phew, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah!
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, mmm, ngh!
Misaki's tortured breaths blow over my face.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah... Y-Y'know...
Misaki gives me a nervous grin.
【Masaya】
What?
【Misaki】
I thought first kisses were meant to be more, like, all gentle and tender and stuff... Wouldn't a light peck have done the job?
【Masaya】
I-I guess so... Mmmph!
【Misaki】
Mmmph!
I gently peck her on the lips.
【Misaki】
Th-That's kinda late...
【Masaya】
Just got the order mixed up.
【Misaki】
I-I guess... Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah... Oh, I can't take it.
【Masaya】
Can't take what?
Misaki is trembling so much that I can see her shaking.
【Misaki】
My feelings for you are so strong that I just know this is bad!
【Masaya】
What's so bad about it?
【Misaki】
'C-Cause I know I'm gonna start spouting all this embarrassing crap. I'm scared of myself, okay? I've never felt this way before... Ugh, I'm scared of how just kissing has made me get! I <i>really</i> like you!
【Masaya】
I really like you too, Misaki.
【Misaki】
Ughhh, I didn't wanna seem this pathetic around you! But I can't just not say it! I-I-I love you!
【Masaya】
That's not pathetic. Hell, it's anything but.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah...
Misaki starts pounding my chest before bumping her head against it.
【Misaki】
I thought I could handle this fine... but a single kiss made me lose it. Ugh, I keep falling harder! What am I gonna do if I end up loving you more than this?!
【Masaya】
Sounds good to me.
【Misaki】
It's fine, but it's scary. You know how annoying I can be.
【Masaya】
You're actually aware of that?
【Misaki】
S-So, like... I dunno what's gonna happen to me.
【Masaya】
It's fine. I love everything about you.
【Misaki】
God, you're so cool! I don't even wanna be saying this! You're just so damn cool, Masaya!
【Masaya】
Why don't you want to say that?!
Her annoying side has surfaced already.
【Masaya】
I'm gonna kiss you again.
【Misaki】
What're you trying to do, make me fall for you even more?! You're gonna end up on a most wanted list at this rate!
【Masaya】
I just don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight if I don't.
【Misaki】
Ugh, f-fine.
【Masaya】
I'll be gentle this time.
【Misaki】
Th-That sounds... Gah... Great!
Why was there a "gah" in the middle there?
【Masaya】
Here I go.
【Misaki】
O-Okay.
Misaki stands as still as she was when Shirase-san was tuning her Grav Shoes. I don't really know how I'm meant to go about a gentle kiss. However...
I think as long as I take things slowly, everything will turn out fine.
I'm sure my feelings will get through to her if I do, and right now I want to be gentle.
And so, I convince myself that going slow will make that happen.
【Misaki】
Mmmph!
Time passes as I press my lips against hers and take things slow.
【Misaki】
Mmmph... Mmm... Mmmph... Mmm...
Misaki's nasal breathing is more relaxed than it was before.
I part from her.
【Masaya】
I love you, Misaki.
【Misaki】
Y-Yeah, I... love you too.
Misaki nods, her face bright red.
【Misaki】
I-I'm not going anywhere... So, um... make sure you don't either.
【Masaya】
I-I won't. Let me do this properly, though. Misaki, will you go out with me?
【Misaki】
O-Of course!
Misaki nods, her expression completely serious.
【Misaki】
Haaah... Mmm! Ngh, ah!
【Masked Skywalker】
Ngh! Huh? Mmmmmm!
Shirase-san looks up in wonder as Misaki and Mask go at it on the field above.
【Shirase】
Man, Misaki's movements have gotten a lot sharper over this past week.
【Masaya】
Yeah, she's improved tons.
【Shion】
She can even stop me once out of every three times while I'm going top speed.
【Shirase】
She's gotten pretty good at stopping Speeders, yeah. She's probably good enough to stop someone using Inui's tactics at the second line now.
【Masaya】
Yeah, but that's not all we have to worry about...
【Shirase】
The main issue is how she'll reclaim the height advantage when she finds herself below her opponent.
【Masaya】
Right. As things stand, she's just jumping to the next line whenever she finds herself at a height disadvantage.
【Shion】
I don't think doing that every single time Inui ends up above her is going to be much of a counter.
【Masaya】
It won't.
It might allow Misaki to keep things close, but she'd still have no hope of winning.
Assume that Misaki started off by jumping lines, allowing Inui to get the first point.
Misaki would have the height advantage on the second line, so Inui would jump to the next line, sacrifice the buoy to Misaki, and it would be 1:1.
Inui would then have the height advantage on the third line, since she got there first, making Misaki jump, resulting in a 1:2 score.
Misaki having the height advantage on the fourth line would make Inui jump again, bringing it to 2:2.
Then we'd be back at the first line, with Inui having the height advantage. Misaki would have to jump lines once again, and the score would be 2:3.
Not being able to dogfight on the first line means she'll always be trailing one point behind.
【Misaki】
Take this! And this!
【Masked Skywalker】
No! You shall not pass!
We've restored her Grav Shoes to their normal settings this time to try out various methods of regaining the height advantage from below. However, this has mostly resulted in her trying to blast through on sheer force alone.
Sometimes, she'll throw a feint to the right before ascending to the left.
Others, she'll openly broadcast her feint to throw Masked Skywalker off balance before pulling off a reversal.
Every so often, she succeeds and manages to regain the height advantage, but...
【Shirase】
This method is too risky to be reliable.
【Masaya】
Yeah. It might work as a surprise attack... but it's just too straight forward.
【Shion】
We need to change our line of thinking.
【Masaya】
Got any suggestions?
【Shion】
The overwhelming advantage of staying above your opponent is so simple, but no one ever realized it.
【Shirase】
So you're saying there might be an equally simple solution?
【Shion】
I think so. One of those things that'll make us go, "Why'd no one ever think of this before?" when we figure it out.
【Masaya】
Why'd no one ever think of it before, huh...?
Prez might be right on this one.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah...
I can hear Misaki panting for breath through my headset as I watch her shoulders heaving.
How would Asuka be faring if she was going through all this?
I know I shouldn't compare them, but...
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah...
I can't stop myself from wondering.
If Asuka were up there, she may have another flash of inspiration and figure out a way to break through.
Asuka's the type of person who can do it. Someone who can fly in a way that exceeds my expectations.
Can Misaki do that too?
I knew comparing them was wrong.
Misaki has her own strengths. It's my job to bring them to the surface.
【Shion】
Hm?
Prez suddenly looks behind him.
【Masaya】
What's up?
【Shion】
Isn't that Shindou?
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Shirase】
Oh, so it is.
Shindou-san is briskly walking toward us.
【Shindou】
Hey there.
【Masaya】
Hello, what brings you here?
【Shion】
He's here to finally take me on, of course! The summer tournament may be over, but it's time for us presidents to have our showdown!
【Shindou】
I'm too afraid of losing to you at the moment, Aoyagi-kun, so I'll have to pass.
【Shion】
Heh, running scared, are we?
【Shindou】
I take it that means you haven't given up on FC, then?
【Shion】
Of course not! I still haven't surpassed the speed of light.
【Shindou】
Great. Keep on giving it your all... I'm looking forward to seeing how far you'll go.
Their conversation ends without me being able to tell how serious either of them were actually being. Then, Shindou-san turns to face me.
【Masaya】
So, did you need something?
【Shindou】
Yes, there's something I want to talk about.
Shindou-san breathes a small sigh, then glances up at the sky.
【Shindou】
Whoa!
He arches backward like he's just been hit by lightning.
【Masaya】
Wh-What's the matter?
【Shindou】
Th-The Mysterious Masked Skywalker! The Mysterious Masked Skywalker who's totally devoid of technique and a complete weakling!
【Masaya】
Please don't say that, you're making me feel sorry for them.
It's depressing enough that they have no tricks up their sleeve despite the mask they're wearing, without bringing their strength into it too.
【Masaya】
They still have a lot to learn, but they take their practice really seriously.
They may be a little on the eccentric side, but I take my hat off to them for their hard work and determination.
【Shindou】
So that's what's going on, is it?
【Masaya】
...What's going on?
【Shindou】
The mask was your scheme. Think you'd be kind enough to tell me the point of this strategy?
【Masaya】
I'm not scheming, and this isn't part of my strategy.
【Shindou】
Hehehe, you think I'll believe you when you're practicing with that oddball?
【Masaya】
I don't even know who Masked Skywalker really is. I asked Shirase-san to help out with Misaki's practice, and he brought them along. You should direct your questions to him.
【Shirase】
For the record, I don't know who Masked Skywalker really is, either. We're just acquaintances.
Shindou-san looks between the two of us.
【Shindou】
What are you two up to?
【Masaya】
We're not up to anything.
【Shindou】
Knowing Shirase-san, this could all be part of a masterplan. That man is godlike.
【Shirase】
Hahahaha, flattery won't get you any discounts.
【Shion】
Shindou, I think you have something more important to worry about than whatever those two are up to.
【Shindou】
I do?
Prez strikes a pose.
【Shion】
Haven't you been slacking on your deltoid training?
【Shindou】
Y-You think?
Shindou-san starts feeling up his own shoulders.
【Shion】
Often in FC, you'll need to throw out your arms to change your course. You wouldn't want to end up losing because you haven't trained your deltoids enough for that, would you?
【Shindou】
I wouldn't want to lose regardless...
【Shirase】
Mhm... Would you mind if I had a feel?
【Shindou】
If you really want to...
【Shirase】
I see...
Prez also reaches out.
【Shion】
Hm, these are quite the latissimus dorsi.
【Shindou】
Mmm... Ah, wh-why are you touching me like that?
【Shirase】
You're a bit tense. Try and relax, okay? We won't be able to get a feel for your muscle definition if you don't.
【Shindou】
Oh, okay... Mmm, ngh, haaah!
Prez and Shirase-san relentlessly rub their hands all over Shindou-san.
【Shion】
You're pretty good, Shindou. That's it, you're now an honorary Muscle Brother.
【Shindou】
Huh?
【Masaya】
...When did you guys name yourselves that?
【Misaki】
Whoa?! What the hell? What's going on? This again, really? Oh, not Shindou-san too... To think he was one of them all along.
Before long, Misaki has flown down to us. She seems real surprised.
【Shindou】
No, Tobisawa-kun, this isn't--
【Shion】
We're not handing Shindou over.
【Misaki】
God, the two of you were bad enough. If he's like that, you can keep him.
Misaki hangs her head in disappointment.
【Misaki】
Haaah... At this rate, it's only a matter of time before Masaya goes to join you on Planet Brawn.
【Masaya】
Um...
【Masked Skywalker】
Masaya-san's joining them?! Not a bad idea!
【Masaya】
What?!
【Misaki】
Are you a fan of muscles, Mask?
【Masked Skywalker】
On occasion!
【Misaki】
Yeah, I guess they are kinda sexy.
【Masked Skywalker】
D-Don't say that word! Have you no shame?! To the gallows with you!
【Misaki】
Don't mind if I do.
As the conversation heads in its usual direction, I clap my hands to bring it to a stop.
【Masaya】
Okay, that's enough nonsense. You came here for a reason, right, Shindou-san?
【Shindou】
I heard you and Tobisawa-kun had split off from your club, so I wanted to see what was going on. Why didn't you ever speak to me about it?
【Masaya】
I'm sorry. I thought about speaking to you, of course, but I didn't want to turn this into a whole big thing...
Having Prez and Masked Skywalker help out is no big deal, but having someone as good as Shindou-san helping could have come with a whole host of problems.
Him coming to help us out would've been big news, which probably would've brought the split in our FC club to light. I can't even begin to imagine what kind of a messy situation that would turn out to be.
Besides, it would've been inconsiderate to the students at Takafuji.
【Shindou】
I wouldn't have been able to help if you'd called me anyway.
【Misaki】
Huh, why not? Please join us!
【Shindou】
Kurashina-kun's practicing at our school, but I'm not getting involved in her practice sessions either.
【Masaya】
Why not?
【Shindou】
Because I don't think it's a good idea for me to have any influence over who wins when it's time for them to face each other.
【Masaya】
You sure you're not overthinking this?
【Shindou】
I have a rather big mouth on me, you see.
【Masaya】
Oh, so that's what it is.
【Shindou】
Mhm...
Asuka's training to beat Misaki, and Misaki's training to beat Asuka.
Shindou-san's making sure he doesn't leak what's going on in either of their sessions.
【Shindou】
That being said, there is something I want to show you.
【Masaya】
What's that?
Shindou-san pulls a laptop out of his bag.
【Shindou】
A video of Kurashina-kun's match.
【Masaya】
Asuka's match?
【Misaki】
......
From a corner of my eye, I see Misaki clenching her fists. I'm scared, but I don't have time to confirm things.
【Masaya】
So, who was her opponent?
【Misaki】
The fact you're showing this to us means it wasn't Satouin-san or Ichinose-chan, I'll bet.
【Shindou】
Saki Inui.
【Masaya/Misaki】
Ah...!
【Masaya】
Ah...!
【Misaki】
Ah...!
【Masaya】
Aoi-san said she was gonna put Asuka through all the practice matches she could. You're telling me Inui accepted one of those?
If so, it might not be a bad idea for us to just go ahead and propose a practice match of our own.
【Shindou】
Oh no, Kurashina-kun wasn't the one who asked for the match.
【Masaya】
You mean Inui did?
【Shindou】
Exactly.
So Inui took an interest in Asuka? No, I'll bet it was her second, Irina, who did.
She did say all those things about her back at the summer tournament.
【Shindou】
She suddenly arrived at our school by helicopter.
【Everyone】
Helicopter?!
【Masaya】
Helicopter?!
【Misaki】
Helicopter?!
【Shion】
Helicopter?!
【Masked Skywalker】
Helicopter?!
【Shindou】
Hahahaha, impressive, huh?
【Shion】
That's not impressive at all. A helicopter will never travel faster than light speed no matter how hard it tries.
【Masaya】
You're the only one who can go faster than light speed, Prez.
【Shion】
I knew you'd get it, Hinata!
【Shirase】
Inui-chan must be rich if she's using a private helicopter.
【Shindou】
I don't know the details myself, but I'm pretty sure it's Irina-kun who's rich.
【Masaya】
Don't you know anything about Inui, Shirase-san?
【Shirase】
She's been on my radar for a while now... My job has me talking to people related to FC a lot, so I get information even when I'm lounging around the store. Hm, let me look into it.
【Misaki】
So, what happened after the helicopter landed?
【Shindou】
She demanded that we let her have a match with Kurashina-kun. She's been coming to us a lot for practice since the training camp.
Must be because her only other training partner was Mashiro.
All because Misaki and I left...
A dull pain spreads through me. I can't tell if it's regret, self-loathing, malice, jealousy, or what.
Asuka's smiling face floats across my mind. The smile of someone who truly loves FC.
I take deep breaths to blow away the pain. There's no turning back time, and there's no point in dwelling on the past.
Right now, I have to focus on Misaki, and only her.
To do otherwise would be to do a disservice to both her and Asuka.
【Shindou】
Ms. Kagami was opposed, but Kurashina-kun insisted she wanted to do it.
【Masaya】
I guess Inui's second was Irina-san, but who was Asuka's? Aoi-san?
【Shindou】
Irina-kun said she'd have been fine with that, but having one second be a teacher would have made things unfair. Ms. Kagami was once a distinguished Skywalker in her own right, too.
【Misaki】
Was it Mashiro, then?
【Shindou】
Satou-kun handled it.
【Masaya】
Satou-kun? Oh, you mean Satouin-san.
【Shindou】
Those two really seem to get along. Satou-kun's been putting in a lot of effort with Kurashina-kun. Apparently they plan out new tactics together all the time.
So they ended up hitting it off, huh? Satouin-san sure is open-minded. Being able to accept her defeat and become friends must be tough.
Can't say I'm all that surprised, though.
【Misaki】
So, how'd the match turn out?
【Shindou】
That's what I'm about to show you. It was pretty strange.
Shindou-san starts the video.
【Misaki】
Ah...!
By the time the video's over, Misaki is left speechless.
【Misaki】
Ngh...
We continue to stare at the black screen.
【Shindou】
Well?
【Misaki】
U-Um...
Misaki's mouth flaps open and shut for a while as she tries to answer.
【Misaki】
This is, um... This is...
She looks over at Masked Skywalker.
【Masked Skywalker】
The same as what we've been practicing.
【Masaya】
Yeah, identical.
【Shindou】
Makes sense that you've made it this far as well, Tobisawa-kun.
The match went as follows:
Asuka jumped to the second line, allowing Inui to touch second and score a point.
Inui then proceeded to fly along the next line as fast as she could until Asuka body blocked her. Inui used the recoil from this to gain the height advantage.
Realizing that, Asuka immediately jumped to the next line, relinquishing the buoy to Inui and making it 0:2.
On the third line, Asuka made sure to always stick to a height where she'd be able to block Inui. She changed her height to match Inui's movements as she moved up and down while traveling along the line. Realizing what Asuka was doing, Inui jumped to the fourth line.
Asuka touched the buoy, making it 1:2.
The rest of the match played out with someone shortcutting the moment they lost the height advantage.
Final score: 5:7. Inui won.
【Shirase】
Guess that means we're barking up the right tree?
【Masaya】
I guess so... But something felt off.
【Shion】
The two of them were acting strange.
【Masaya】
Yeah, I agree.
There's a reason for that.
Misaki audibly gulps.
【Misaki】
The two of them are hiding something.
【Shirase】
Seems like it. That's why the match played out the way it did.
【Masaya】
Asuka wouldn't have let the match play out like that if they weren't.
【Misaki】
Yeah, she wasn't performing the way she usually does.
She'd never jump to the next line so readily when she's trailing on points. Not without trying to put up a fight, at least.
Everything I know about Asuka tells me she would've done everything she could to come back from a two point deficit.
【Masked Skywalker】
You're saying these two people who need sending to the gallows are hiding something?
【Masaya】
That's one way of putting it...
【Shirase】
I bet it's a way of regaining the height advantage from below.
【Shindou】
I knew it...
【Masaya】
You think so too, Shindou-san?
【Shindou】
Yeah. Neither of them wanted to show their trump card before the fall tournament.
【Misaki】
The fall tournament...
There's a sense of panic in Misaki's eyes.
【Shindou】
I think Inui-kun's intent was to crush Kurashina-kun, a rising star, but she completely failed.
【Masaya】
Neither of them showing their trump card means we have bigger problems than whether someone was crushed or not.
They both displayed how far they could go.
But at the same time, they kept their true potentials hidden.
【Misaki】
Our main issue is working out how to reclaim the height advantage from below, right?
【Shindou】
I've been thinking about that too, not that I have an answer to the question yet.
【Masaya】
You didn't ask Asuka or Satouin-san about it?
【Shindou】
I couldn't. I'd have been way too tempted to tell you or Tobisawa-kun about it.
Shindou-san shrugs his shoulders.
【Shindou】
As badly as I want to know what the answer is, that just wouldn't have been fair.
Misaki exaggerates a pout.
【Misaki】
Booo! You could've just told me in secret. Shindou-san, you big meanie!
He forces a smile.
【Shindou】
You know I couldn't have. I just thought it was okay to show you this match, since everyone from our FC club saw it anyway.
【Masaya】
I really am grateful you did. It's a great reference.
【Shindou】
Well, that's all I came here to do.
Shindou-san puts his laptop away in his backpack.
【Masaya】
You're not gonna watch us training?
【Shindou】
Tobisawa-kun's in the middle of her secret special training, right? I better not, unless you want me to blab to others about it.
【Misaki】
It's really not that big a deal.
【Shindou】
Even so, I think this is for the best. See you around, guys.
【Masaya】
Actually, Shindou-san, could I have a moment?
【Shindou】
What's up?
【Masaya】
I wouldn't want to keep you, so how about I walk with you?
【Shindou】
Sure.
【Masaya】
Misaki, you keep on practicing with Mask in the meantime.
【Misaki】
Rogeeer!
Misaki mutters, clearly displeased.
【Shindou】
I doubt anyone will hear us now that we're this far away. What was it you wanted to ask?
【Masaya】
You're the only one who's been up against Misaki, Asuka, and Inui.
【Shindou】
I hadn't realized... But yeah, I guess so.
【Masaya】
Would you mind sharing your impressions of them with me?
【Shindou】
...Just what is it you want from me, Hinata-kun?
【Masaya】
Just your impressions, that's all.
【Shindou】
That's a difficult question. The easiest person to answer for would be Inui-kun. Playing against her is like thinking you're going into a soccer match only to find out you're playing baseball.
【Masaya】
I think I know what you mean.
【Shindou】
It's like thinking you're going into a swordfight, then having your opponent pull a pistol on you. It's an entirely different game.
Irina-san said something along the same lines, about how what Asuka and Shindou-san were playing wasn't FC.
【Masaya】
You did well to match Inui, then.
【Shindou】
I was desperate. Everything was so different that I realized I just wasn't good enough straight away.
Impressive, if unsurprising, that he came to that conclusion.
【Shindou】
It's too bad I wasn't able to win, but that match was shocking enough to make losing seem inconsequential.
【Masaya】
I don't know if it's fine for me to ask this, but...
It feels rude to keep asking questions about a match he lost, but I need to.
【Masaya】
How'd you feel after the match?
【Shindou】
Like everything I'd worked so hard for was useless. I thought about quitting FC.
【Masaya】
I understand, trust me.
The feeling of losing. The feeling of seeing someone far better than you.
They make you want to run away from reality.
【Masaya】
Why didn't you quit?
【Shindou】
Because I thought it was fun, too.
That's probably the same way Asuka sees things. A viewpoint I was never able to reach.
【Shindou】
The entire history of FC is based around things changing on a fundamental level. Don't you think that's what makes it fun?
【Masaya】
......
【Shindou】
We're in the middle of forming what FC will be. We're lucky we get to play right as it's being developed. The Skywalkers ten years from now will play a version of FC that we've perfected.
【Masaya】
Maybe, yeah.
【Shindou】
But the only way for us to do that is by trial and error. Don't you think we're lucky to be participating in such an important era?
Asuka really is incredible.
I'm even more convinced of that now.
I think Shindou-san's opinion more or less matches up with hers. But there <i>is</i> a fundamental difference.
Shindou-san only came to this conclusion after considering giving up on FC.
He thinks it's incredible to be right in the middle of this maelstrom, even if it means everything he's practiced is now worthless.
I'm sure he had to convince himself of that.
But Asuka is different. The moment after she saw Shindou-san play Inui...
The <i>very moment</i> after...
She was excited.
【Masaya】
What'd you think about Asuka?
【Shindou】
I've never seen someone grow so much during a match. Kurashina-kun kept on getting better... It's tricky, but I guess I was afraid, and annoyed, but I was also delighted.
【Masaya】
...You were?
【Shindou】
It's fun to see someone improve so much.
Does he really think that?
You know, I think he does. I enjoy seeing Misaki grow myself.
【Shindou】
She has talent, that's for sure... But I think there might be a frailness to her.
【Masaya】
You do?
【Shindou】
If she has someone to make up for that, she might just become one of the best players FC has ever seen.
Someone to make up for Asuka's frailness.
By all rights, that should have been me. But I've lost that position.
I don't hate Asuka, obviously. I like her, not in a romantic way, and I respect her too.
But I had to make my choice. I wasn't in the right frame of mind to coach everyone. I know that, yet...
I don't regret choosing Misaki either, but...
I can feel a dull pain spreading through me.
I wonder how and where Asuka's practicing right now?
The emotions spiral inside me.
【Masaya】
What about Misaki?
【Shindou】
That's who you wanted to ask about most, right?
【Masaya】
Yeah... Yeah, it was. What kind of player do you think Misaki is?
【Shindou】
Tobisawa-kun's...
Shindou-san throws his gaze down a few meters to the side of us as he searches for the words to use.
【Shindou】
An annoying player.
【Masaya】
Annoying...? What do you mean by that?
【Shindou】
First of all, I think she'd be a pain to coach.
【Masaya】
You could tell that from your match?
【Shindou】
Her stubbornness and strength of will were rather obvious. It can't be easy to coach a player like that. But that's also not what I meant by annoying...
【Masaya】
......
【Shindou】
I mean that playing against Tobisawa-kun is annoying.
【Masaya】
Oh?
【Shindou】
Inui-kun's strength is her element of surprise. Kurashina-kun's strength is her ability to find the game fun. Tobisawa-kun's strength is how annoying she can be.
【Masaya】
Surprise, fun, and then annoying, huh? Misaki's the only one with a negative description.
【Shindou】
Hahahaha, you could take it that way, but I don't mean it like that.
【Masaya】
Really?
【Shindou】
Tobisawa-kun excels at the subtle techniques. That makes her annoying.
【Masaya】
You might call them techniques, but she basically just pulls them off through intuition alone.
【Shindou】
Yeah, I figured that out when we were in close combat during the last training camp. Those aren't the kind of moves you can simply learn to pull off.
【Masaya】
So she's an annoying opponent, huh?
【Shindou】
On a broad scale, she might not be the best. But on a smaller scale, I think she could be incredibly strong.
【Masaya】
You mean like during dogfights?
【Shindou】
Dogfights are part of it, but that's not all... I think her strength is best used if she can narrow the scope of the match.
【Masaya】
You do?
【Shindou】
Inui-kun dominates by using the entire breadth of the field, right? Well, I think Tobisawa-kun can do the complete opposite.
Come to think about it, when she first played against Shindou-san, she drew in from the front and gradually launched attacks at him. It was similar with Ichinose, where she narrowed the playing field against her and came out on top.
【Masaya】
Now that you mention it...
He's just given me something to think about.
【Masaya】
One more thing... It might be hard to answer, and it's kind of a ridiculous question, but would you mind?
【Shindou】
Go ahead. It's an honor to answer your questions.
【Masaya】
There's no need for flattery.
【Shindou】
I mean it. So, what's the question?
【Masaya】
Anyone can see that Asuka has talent. But, what do you think about Misaki, in comparison to her?
【Shindou】
I don't think you can simply say someone has talent or they don't.
【Masaya】
Right...
【Shindou】
You train and you practice, you build up experience through matches... and then, only at that point, can you compare talent.
【Masaya】
I know that.
There are those who get the hang of things only after an extensive amount of practice. There are those who may get the hang of everything at once right at the start, but struggle to proceed from there. Those people are of equal worth.
Nobody knows how long it will take someone to truly master something. That's why it's not as simple as just saying someone has talent, or that they don't.
【Shindou】
But, if I'm to speak from my experience... Tobisawa-kun is a genius.
【Masaya】
......
For a moment, everything goes dark.
It feels like my legs have given out and I've slumped to the ground.
It takes a while for me to realize that I'm feeling relieved.
It's the feeling of eventual calm after a long storm.
【Shindou】
......
My shoulders begin to tremble as I watch Shindou-san nod.
Something that I can only describe as joy begins to spread through me. I'm elated from the tips of my toes to the top of my head.
Yes! Misaki is a genius!
I yell that inside my mind to convince myself.
It's only now that I realize I've been waiting for someone to say that to me all along.
【Shindou】
Hehe, you're grinning.
【Masaya】
Am not.
【Shindou】
Though I think we're still too young to know whether someone's a genius or if they're just normal.
【Masaya】
You'd lift me up only to go and say that?
【Shindou】
My point is that making Tobisawa-kun believe she's a genius will help her get much further.
【Masaya】
You're saying that job's up to me?
【Shindou】
It is, Hinata-kun. If she believes she's a genius, she'll push herself further in an attempt to live up to that. It'll give her the belief that, one day, she'll be able to do everything she can't right now.
【Masaya】
So I should compliment her to help her grow?
【Shindou】
No. I'm saying you need to train her as a genius.
【Masaya】
So just treat her like one?
【Shindou】
Not quite. Anyone who can grow from believing they're a genius... is a genius.
【Masaya】
......
Well, um, uh... I mean, that's a pretty good point.
My own instabilities are what made things worse for Misaki.
She tried to leave FC because I didn't believe in her.
Thinking back, it was probably Aoi-san's belief in me that helped me get so far.
And I was coaching without understanding that simple fact...
The regret hurts.
Emotions have built up within me to the point where I want to cry.
Those harsh things Shirase-san and Aoi-san said about Misaki were the same, I just didn't realize it.
They were questioning if I had the resolve to believe in Misaki, even if she was doomed as a player.
Their words were meant for me, not her.
Ugh, shit!
There was no malice behind what they said. Even I know that much.
All they wanted was to make me think.
My emotions continue to spiral within me.
【Masaya】
Thank you, seriously. I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
【Shindou】
I'm just glad my advice has helped.
【Masaya】
It really has. Just, thank you so much.
【Shindou】
It's no big deal.
【Masaya】
It is to me.
My conversation with Shindou-san has given me a lot to think about, and a lot of opportunities to seize.
I bow to him.
【Masaya】
Are you sure you can't be one of Misaki's practice partners?
【Shindou】
I'd be happy to, after the fall tournament.
But it'll be too late by then.
【Shindou】
Come now, don't give me those puppy dog eyes... I'd be more than happy to practice with you whenever, Hinata-kun.
【Masaya】
With me? Nah, I'll pass.
【Shindou】
I'll be waiting for you to change your mind.
He says that with a deadly serious expression.
I scream into my headset.
【Masaya】
Faster! Faster! Push those Grav Shoes to the limit! I know you can do this, Misaki!
【Misaki】
Meoooooooooooooooooow!
Everyone else had to skip today's practice, meaning it's just me and her. Our schedule today is focused on field flying.
【Masaya】
There's still more in there, I know it. Go go go!
【Misaki】
Nghmeoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!
Her posture has her flying almost flat at the water's surface as she picks up speed. Just from looking at her, I can tell her arm and neck muscles must be strained to the limit.
【Masaya】
I know it's tough, but you'll definitely get stronger if you just push through it.
【Misaki】
Hmmeoooooooooooooooooow!
Fighter Grav Shoes have weak acceleration.
Misaki's wearing Laevateinn from Invade.
They're typical Fighter shoes with pretty fast initial velocity and pretty slow acceleration.
As typical as they may be, one doesn't simply fly according to their Grav Shoe specs. This is because the posture of the person wearing them has a large part to play.
Take, for example, the Enshuus from Mizuki. They were developed as Fighter Grav Shoes, but found popularity amongst All-Rounders.
What I wanted to find out was what top speed Misaki could reach in her Laevateinn, and how long it took for her to reach that speed.
In a hypothetical scenario where Misaki simply had to wait out twenty seconds to win the match, and she was further up the line than her opponent, would her best option be to shoot for the buoy at full speed or block her opponent's path?
Or in a case where she needed to score one point in those twenty remaining seconds to win. Should she aim to touch the buoy or her opponent's back?
These are all valuable statistics when having to make a judgment in the heat of the moment.
【Misaki】
Hmmeoooooooooooooooooow!
【Masaya】
Keep going, you can do this!
I yell to try and motivate her.
But I think we're at the end here.
I expect Misaki's gotten everything she can out of her Grav Shoes. It won't matter how much effort she puts in now. This is the limit.
【Masaya】
Okay, break!
【Misaki】
Aaaaaah!
Inertia carries an exhausted Misaki away from the field. She slowly rotates to face me while being carried off in the opposite direction.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah!
【Masaya】
You okay?
【Misaki】
I'm fine. Totes fine, just tired.
Maybe I had her flying at full speed for too long.
It's not exactly the easiest thing for Fighters like her to do.
【Masaya】
Come down here and get some water.
【Misaki】
Ugh... I wanna, but I can't fly that far.
【Masaya】
Okay, I'll bring some up to you. Try not to float away.
【Misaki】
Candy too! There's some in my bag.
【Masaya】
Seriously?
I'd rather she didn't eat too much.
【Misaki】
C'mon, just a little. You're the one who told me the body needs sugar for upkeep and recovering from exhaustion, Masaya.
【Masaya】
I <i>did</i> say that...
I was talking about the sugar in sports drinks. I'm not sure the sugar in candy is good for you.
Oh well, a little can't hurt.
This is stressful training. No need to add the stress of a candy ban on top of that.
I grab hold of the drink and the candy.
【Masaya】
FLY!
I activate my Grav Shoes.
【Misaki】
Ugh... Haaah, haaah... Haaah, haaah...
Misaki's limbs are all hanging loosely by her sides.
【Masaya】
Good work. Have some water first.
She immediately snaps back to life.
【Misaki】
No, candy comes first!
【Masaya】
...Isn't your mouth all dry?
【Misaki】
So what?
【Masaya】
Uh, it'll be hard to eat?
【Misaki】
A little old thing like that won't get in the way of me eating candy! To the gallows with you!
【Masaya】
Don't mind if I do. Okay, fine. It's your choice what you do first. I'm gonna chuck some over, so make sure to catch them.
【Misaki】
Yeah, yeah.
Since coming into contact would make our membranes repel each other, we can only hand things from person to person by throwing them.
I make a gentle underhand throw at Misaki's chest.
【Misaki】
God, I've been waiting for this! I'm starving! Hehehe, time to gobble you up.
She opens the bag and pops some of the chocolate covered candy into her mouth.
【Misaki】
Wow! The exhaustion makes it taste even sweeter than usual! Man, this is what my hard work was for.
【Masaya】
That's your reason for practicing?
She's like an old man who's just finished a round of golf or come out of the sauna.
【Misaki】
I'm so dehydrated that it's hard to swallow, but I have to say it's not that bad.
【Masaya】
What are you, a masochist?
【Misaki】
Oh please, I'm still just a beginner. Apparently when you get really advanced, you learn to enjoy the feel of powdered candy sticking to the insides of your throat.
【Masaya】
Sorry, what were we talking about again?
She just said something completely incomprehensible. I feel like anyone who's gone that far needs to reconsider their life.
【Misaki】
Mmm! Enough! I would be most obliged if you could hand me my water now.
【Masaya】
Why're you talking like that?!
I ask that question as I throw her the bottle.
【Misaki】
Dunno, but I hear people talking like it all the time in the historical shows my grandma watches.
We chat while Misaki grabs the bottle and pops open the lid.
【Misaki】
Mgh, mmm, mmmmmm... Pwaaah!
She downs the drink in one go.
【Misaki】
Okay, catch!
【Masaya】
Sure thing.
I catch the bottle in both hands to make sure I don't drop it.
【Misaki】
Haaah...
【Masaya】
Still feeling tired?
【Misaki】
That's part of it.
【Masaya】
What's up?
【Misaki】
Hm...
Misaki stares out over the horizon.
I follow her gaze.
【Masaya】
Can you see something?
Nothing seems out of place to me.
【Misaki】
Hm... There's a cluster of UFOs flying over there.
【Masaya】
Huh, there is?
I think about asking if she's developing floaters, but think better of it.
In any case, I don't see any UFOs on the horizon.
【Misaki】
Did you know that UFOs can take on many different shapes?
【Masaya】
Nope.
【Misaki】
There's the Adamski types, the cigar types, etc. My dad has some really old books on UFOs that I read when I was little.
【Masaya】
Oh?
【Misaki】
UFO stands for unidentified flying object. Anything that flies in the sky that you don't know the true nature of is a UFO.
【Masaya】
...There is that crazy conspiracy theory that says the technology behind Grav Shoes was handed to us by aliens.
【Misaki】
I've never heard that one before.
【Masaya】
...I think it's time for you to get to the point.
【Misaki】
Just wondering if a cluster of UFOs is gonna fly over soon.
【Masaya】
Can we end this conversation already?
【Misaki】
As my coach and boyfriend, you should be able to humor your girlfriend-cum-player with whatever conversation she pleases.
【Masaya】
...Okay, go on.
【Misaki】
Haaah, geez. You can be so cold sometimes. Like... have you ever just hoped a meteorite would come crashing down?
【Masaya】
I hear people in the trade will pay a fortune for meteorites.
【Misaki】
Seriously?! Twinkle twinkle, little meteor, how I wonder when you'll crash down to Earth.
【Masaya】
Kinda sounds like you're singing a baby to sleep, despite the questionable lyrics.
【Misaki】
It's a good song.
【Masaya】
Just get to the main point already!
【Misaki】
I've been on the main point this whole time!
【Masaya】
UFOs and meteorites?
【Misaki】
Yeah, like if a UFO did fly over here, it wouldn't really be the time for playing FC, would it?
【Masaya】
Huh...? If you take the U and O out of UFO and add a C, you get FC.
【Misaki】
Whoa, what a discovery! I think we've just uncovered a conspiracy by the American government, Hinata-kun!
【Masaya】
Yep, I think we're onto something here. So, what's with this meteorite business?
【Misaki】
Just hoping like, if a meteorite did fall, maybe it would land on my foot and gimme a sprain.
【Masaya】
...What do you mean?
【Misaki】
It doesn't even need to be something that unrealistic. The meteor could fall on the site of the fall tournament and destroy it. That way, the whole thing'll get called off.
【Masaya】
That sounds pretty unrealistic to me.
【Misaki】
Or I could just be walking down the road when a bike comes speeding along and breaks my leg.
【Masaya】
Huh? You want to get injured?
【Misaki】
Yeah, I do.
【Masaya】
Can't believe you're saying that with a straight face. It'd be one thing if you were talking about how to <i>avoid</i> getting injured...
【Misaki】
Honestly, I want to get injured in a way that's not my fault at all. It'd be nice if I couldn't participate in the fall tournament, or it got canceled, and there was nothing I could do about it.
At long last, I finally understand what she's talking about.
【Masaya】
So that's what's going on...
【Misaki】
Do you understand how I feel, Masaya?
【Masaya】
Yeah, I used to think like that a lot. I'd hope a giant monster would appear out of the ocean and ruin everything.
【Misaki】
Oh, that'd be great. But it's not very realistic.
【Masaya】
Less so than a meteorite, I guess. Are you worried about the match?
【Misaki】
...Yeah. I am. I'm <i>super</i> nervous.
She doesn't know if she'll win. She doesn't even know what her opponent might do. And yet, she has to go up against them anyway.
She has to participate in the tournament anyway.
I know what it's like to hope you might come down with a minor sickness so you can run away from it all. Or, at the very least, if you went and lost, you could just blame it on your illness.
【Masaya】
Everyone who plays in sports like ours thinks things like that at least once. It happens all the time.
【Misaki】
I see. It happens all the time, huh?
【Masaya】
You want to run away from the match, right?
【Misaki】
I want to run. I want to quit FC.
【Masaya】
Hey, I thought you said you'd made up your mind.
【Misaki】
I did! That's why I'm practicing, and why I'm simulating matches with the Mr. Shitous on my days off from practicing!
【Masaya】
I know that.
【Misaki】
Then don't be mean and start questioning my motivation!
【Masaya】
That was mean?
【Misaki】
Obviously! I'm practicing because I made my mind up. If I hadn't, I wouldn't feel like this!
【Masaya】
Right.
It's because she's actually taking this seriously that she's getting anxious.
【Masaya】
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
【Misaki】
Apologize!
【Masaya】
Um, I already said I'm sorry?
【Misaki】
Ughhh! Ughhhhhh! Grrrrrrrrr!
【Masaya】
Don't growl at me.
【Misaki】
I hope my Grav Shoes break mid-flight and I get so badly injured that I can't compete in the fall tournament! Bring it on, world!
【Masaya】
You shouldn't say things like that.
【Misaki】
I wouldn't say them to anyone other than you!
【Masaya】
That doesn't make me feel better.
【Misaki】
Inui-san... Asuka... How do you think they're practicing right now? How much do you think they've grown since the summer tournament?
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
I haven't even found a way to reclaim the height advantage from below!
【Masaya】
You will, eventually.
【Misaki】
I-I have FC on my mind all the time, even when I'm sleeping.
【Masaya】
Same here.
【Misaki】
No! You're thinking about my FC playing, but <i>I'm</i> thinking about <i>my</i> FC playing.
【Masaya】
That <i>is</i> the same thing.
【Misaki】
No. I'm the one who'll win or lose.
【Masaya】
True.
No matter how much I try and support and protect Misaki, at the end of the day, she's the one who'll win or lose, not me.
【Misaki】
I made up my mind, ditched our club, practiced so hard, had you, Shirase-san, Prez, and Mask help me. But... But... But... What if...
【Masaya】
......
She trembles.
【Misaki】
What if... I lose? What do I do if that happens?
【Masaya】
Nobody would blame you.
【Misaki】
I know that. But it's just, I'm practicing so hard every day. If I lose, then... what even am I?
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
I'm practicing so hard that if I lose, I have no excuses. No one can say that I wasn't taking it seriously... I can't even try and convince myself there was more I could've done. It's scary!
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Misaki】
Can I hold it together if I lose? What... What'll happen to me?
Misaki's face is flushed.
【Misaki】
I don't want to lose to Inui-san <i>or</i> to Asuka. It's not that I want to win, I just don't want to lose. I can't even imagine how I'll feel if I do. I don't want to lose, that's all it is.
【Masaya】
Nobody can help you. If you lose, you just have to accept it.
【Misaki】
I can't accept it! I'm taking this so seriously! I know it's cliched, but I'm literally giving it my all. So if I lose... If I lose, it'll be like I've lost everything too. I'm scared.
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
I'm sure I'll feel dead. They may as well send me to the gallows. I'm gonna die. Obviously, I won't actually... but part of me will.
【Masaya】
You wouldn't think like this if you weren't taking practice seriously, right? So it's a good thing.
【Misaki】
Maybe... Man, I don't even know anymore. If I'd never started taking FC seriously, I never would've had to feel like this, right?
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Misaki】
So I want to quit FC. Obviously, I can't, but I want to. What is this? What is this feeling?
【Masaya】
Just the overwhelming feeling of not wanting to lose. That's all.
【Misaki】
Is there any point to feeling like this?
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
......
【Masaya】
I don't know if there is.
Misaki's face is a mix of relief and disappointment.
【Misaki】
Hahahaha, yeah... Sorry for all the weird questions.
【Masaya】
But...
【Misaki】
Hm?
【Masaya】
I bet this is easier on you than when you said you were gonna quit FC. Harder on the body, but easier on the heart.
【Misaki】
Hm, I dunno. Maybe... Yeah, you may be right. I don't think that's quite the right way of putting it, but I do feel like I'm making progress, so...
【Masaya】
Yeah. If you weren't... I'd be the one suffering.
【Misaki】
You would?
【Masaya】
Yeah. You shine much more now, trying to push ahead, than you did when you were moping around depressed. I hope you can see things that way, too.
【Misaki】
I'm shining! I'm shining so brightly even I can tell! Whoa, that's weird. I can't believe you actually said that with a straight face.
【Masaya】
Quit teasing me! Also, you're making it sound like this is the first time you've felt this way, but that's not true, is it?
【Misaki】
I'm pretty sure I haven't felt this way before.
【Masaya】
And <i>I'm</i> pretty sure you felt this way while watching Asuka's and Inui's matches at the summer tournament.
【Misaki】
Ah...!
【Masaya】
You didn't want to lose back then either, right? But you didn't want to admit how you felt, so you ran away. Which was worse, the way you felt then, or the way you feel now?
【Misaki】
...I guess you've got a point. I can't remember it all that well now, but it was really tough.
【Masaya】
Running away makes some things easier, but it makes other things harder.
I know that all too well.
You have to spend every single day facing up to the fact that you can no longer fly.
【Masaya】
I don't know how you'll end up feeling, but I'm never letting you get away from me, so be ready.
【Misaki】
Great, you're a <i>total</i> stalker now.
【Masaya】
Quit teasing me.
I really want this to get through to her, so I put my heart into my words.
【Masaya】
If there's a meteorite heading your way, I'll block it. If you're about to fall from the sky, I'll be your cushion. If a bomb goes off, I'll cover you.
【Misaki】
......
【Masaya】
There's no running away, so don't even try. I'm taking you to the tournament no matter what.
【Misaki】
I won't run. Yeah.
She gives me a docile nod.
【Misaki】
Sorry, I just like, didn't know what to do about how I felt. I'm fine. Hahahaha, man, yeah. I've never taken anything so seriously before. It's kinda scary.
【Masaya】
I know how it feels.
The reason I was so traumatized after I first met Misaki was because of how seriously I was taking FC.
Despite all my hard work, I lost. Though, I guess it's more accurate to say I was under the mistaken impression that I'd lost.
I'm sure I took it so seriously that it ended up narrowing my field of view.
And that mistaken impression is what made me smolder for so long.
When what I really wanted to do was burn brightly...
【Masaya】
I'm jealous of how you can work so hard. I couldn't do that now, even if I wanted to.
Oh...
I actually just said that.
The moment I notice what I've done, my pulse quickens.
I can actually say these things now.
I didn't even realize I'd come this far.
【Misaki】
Hah! Foolish Masaya, suffer as you watch me fly!
【Masaya】
...Don't mind if I do.
【Misaki】
Mmmmmm...
Misaki stretches out wide like a sleeping kitty.
【Misaki】
Right, well I <i>really</i> don't wanna lose, and I've made up my mind to practice hard, so you better put the screws to me, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Quit making it sound like torture.
【Misaki】
It practically is.
That's such a quick response that I find it hard to argue.
【Masaya】
Okay, we'll do some more field flying today. Same as before, but with Low Yo-Yos and High Yo-Yos mixed in.
【Misaki】
Meowch, this is gonna be tough! May as well give it a shot. Here I go, then!
Misaki throws the box of candy back to me.
【Misaki】
You can have the rest.
She smiles.
【Misaki】
About what we were just saying... I'm gonna have you get serious next.
With that parting remark, she flies off toward the field.
Me, huh?
There's a terrible pain inside my chest.
That dark beast within is poking its tongue out as it taunts me.
Misaki runs along the beach, raising her thighs high and kicking sand up behind her.
【Misaki】
Meow, meooooooooow!
She's been in great form ever since she resumed practice.
【Masaya】
Keep going! You've got this! Keep it up to the end!
【Minamo】
P-Please do your best... You can do this, Tobisawa-san.
【Misaki】
Yes, meow'am! Minamo-chaaaaaaaaaaaan!
Misaki crosses the line drawn in the sand.
【Masaya】
Nice one!
I stop the timer on my phone.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, mmm! How'd I do?
【Masaya】
That's a new personal best.
【Misaki】
I did it!
Minamo-chan starts clapping away.
【Minamo】
Amazing... You were like... a member of the track club.
【Masaya】
Probably faster than the weaker members of the track club, I bet.
【Misaki】
All thanks to Minamo-chan cheering for me.
【Masaya】
You did yell out her name as you crossed the finish line.
【Misaki】
You made that happen. Thanks.
【Minamo】
O-Oh no, I... didn't do... anything...
Shirase-san, Prez, and Masked Skywalker are all taking the day off today.
In exchange, Shirase-san asked Minamo-chan to come and cheer for us.
【Misaki】
Aight! That's it for today.
【Minamo】
Wait... we're... done already...?
【Masaya】
There's a heavy rain forecast for this afternoon, so we're taking the rest of the day off.
I feel like Misaki's been overworking herself lately, so I wanted to take the whole day off. However, she said she'd get too anxious if she did nothing, so we decided to squeeze in a little practice.
【Minamo】
U-Um... Here. My brother asked me... to bring this...
Minamo-chan reaches into her adorable bag and pulls out a paper bag from Shirase Sky Sports.
【Masaya】
What's that?
【Minamo】
It's... protein...
【Misaki】
Whoa! Is Shirase-san trying to get me to join the muscle brigade?
【Minamo】
I don't... think that was... his intent... U-Um... he said... it can help you recover... from fatigue...
【Masaya】
I think you've got the wrong idea here, Misaki. Protein isn't a steroid. It's not gonna make you super bulky.
【Misaki】
Huh, really?
【Masaya】
This type of protein isn't any different from what you get in food. You've never heard of anyone get horribly ripped from eating too much chicken, right? The only difference is you drink this while training to build your muscles effectively.
【Misaki】
Hm, I see now. It also helps recover from fatigue. then?
【Masaya】
Of course. One of the main things it does is help your muscles recover. Shirase-san advised we use it for that, so I imagine it's some sort of special mixture focused on that.
【Misaki】
Why didn't you make me drink protein before this, Masaya?!
【Masaya】
We were trying to get you to slim down, so I didn't think it was necessary. I guess I could have, though.
Misaki turns to Minamo-chan and emphatically bows her head.
【Misaki】
I'm sorry I was mistaken!
【Minamo】
Oh no, it's fine... This is just... a sample... My brother recommended it so... it should be... very useful...
【Misaki】
I see. Well, a sample's more than good enough for me. I'm really touched that he's worrying about me getting too tired. Say, Masaya, when should I drink this?
【Masaya】
Straight after exercising.
【Misaki】
So now, then.
【Minamo】
Shall I... make it... for you..?
【Misaki】
Yeah, if you're fine with it!
【Minamo】
Could I... borrow your... bottle...?
【Masaya】
Sure.
【Minamo】
Thanks...
Minamo-chan pours the powder into the water bottle and closes the lid.
【Minamo】
Shakey shake shake...
Then, she grips it tightly in both hands and starts shaking it around.
【Misaki】
You have to dissolve the powder in water before you drink it?
【Masaya】
You didn't even know that?
【Misaki】
I bet most people go their whole lives without drinking protein.
【Masaya】
Guess you have a point...
I think it sees some use in diets, but Misaki's probably never had to worry about that.
【Minamo】
Okay... All... done...
【Misaki】
Thanks, Minamo-chan!
Misaki pops the lid open.
【Misaki】
Um... I've never had a protein drink before... Do I just drink it like water?
【Minamo】
Yes... Please do...
【Misaki】
Okay, here goes nothing!
She raises the bottle to her mouth and begins to drink.
【Misaki】
Mmm, mmm... Mmmmmmmmm!
【Minamo】
Huh...?
【Misaki】
Ngh?! Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah!
She gulps down the liquid, then starts panting heavily.
【Minamo】
What's... wrong...?
【Masaya】
I can figure that out without asking...
【Misaki】
This is horrible! I've never tasted anything this bad! Why does this exist?! It kinda felt like I was poisoning myself!
【Minamo】
I don't think... it's poisonous...
【Misaki】
S-Sorry, I went too far. B-But, like... Um, this is <i>really</i> awful.
【Minamo】
It... shouldn't be...
【Masaya】
Protein just tastes bad.
【Misaki】
It does?
【Masaya】
High protein stuff is basically the same as sticking non-fatty meat in a blender to turn into a powder.
【Misaki】
If you'd told me that, I wouldn't have had any...
【Masaya】
There've been improvements lately, so apparently some even taste good. But most still taste like crap.
【Misaki】
Yeah but this is <i>worse</i> than crap.
【Minamo】
It smells... like a dog... left out in the rain...
【Misaki】
Yeah, that sums it up perfectly!
【Masaya】
Can't say it sounds all that appealing.
【Minamo】
But... it really is... good for you...
She stares at Misaki's stomach while she says that.
【Misaki】
Ugh...
If Minamo-chan wasn't looking, I imagine Misaki would throw the drink away, but she can hardly do that with how grateful she acted earlier.
【Masaya】
Want me to teach you a trick for drinking protein?
Misaki's eyes glisten.
【Misaki】
Yeah!
【Masaya】
Pinch your nose.
【Misaki】
Primitive, but logical!
【Minamo】
......
Misaki stares at the bottle.
【Misaki】
Mmmmmmmmm, I've got this! Mgh, mgh, mgh, mgh, pwaaah! I drank it all! Thanks, Minamo-chan.
【Minamo】
Oh... no... I hope it... helps you recover...
【Misaki】
I can already feel my muscles regenerating!
【Minamo】
I-I'm... glad...
【Masaya】
Right, go get changed. We can head out soon.
【Misaki】
Sweet.
【Minamo】
You're... going somewhere... together...?
【Masaya】
Today's a stress release day. Figured we'd go hang out somewhere.
【Minamo】
But it's... going to rain... this afternoon, isn't it...?
【Misaki】
A little rain never hurt anyone. Besides, there are tons of places we can go and not get wet. A cafe, the movies, wherever.
【Minamo】
Cafes, movies... That sounds... like a... date...
【Masaya】
Yeah, something like that.
【Minamo】
......
【Misaki】
No way. Dates are serious business. We're just hanging out.
Misaki waves her hands in front of her face, desperately denying that it's a date.
【Minamo】
O-Oh... I see. Well... I should get going before... th-the rain starts...
【Misaki】
Bye!
【Masaya】
Thank your brother for me.
【Minamo】
I-I will...
Minamo-chan bows to us, then trots off toward the road.
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
......
I wait until she's too far away to hear us.
【Masaya】
Why were you denying it's a date so bad?
【Misaki】
Do you <i>really</i> not get it?
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Misaki】
Haaah...
Misaki breathes a short sigh.
【Misaki】
Looks like I've got my work cut out for me with you as a boyfriend, Masaya.
【Masaya】
What's that supposed to mean?
【Misaki】
We're done here. I'm gonna go get changed!
Misaki walks away.
Misaki enters the classroom, spins her arms, and heads toward the window.
【Misaki】
Wow, the sunset's so pretty.
【Masaya】
It was pouring before we went to the theater.
Luckily, the skies had cleared up by the time we left.
We'd just been walking and talking until we found ourselves by school, and decided to drop in.
I thought about going to the clubroom, but...
【Masaya】
(I couldn't bring myself to suggest it.)
I'm sure Misaki feels the exact same way.
【Misaki】
I don't hear the baseball club today.
【Masaya】
Doesn't look like a whole lot of clubs are practicing today.
【Misaki】
And I doubt anyone'll come back to the classroom, either.
Good point. If anyone was around, we'd probably see changes of clothes hanging over lockers, bags left on desks, candy wrappers in the bin, that sort of stuff.
【Misaki】
Think it's 'cause of the rain?
【Masaya】
Yeah, maybe everyone saw the forecast and went home.
I looked up the weather on my phone before the movie, and it had said the rain was gonna continue all night.
Seems the worst of it missed the island, though, so we have this beautiful sunset.
【Misaki】
Hahahaha, it's so empty that it feels like we've been left behind.
【Masaya】
...Not me.
【Misaki】
What do you mean?
【Masaya】
Last time, you were the only one I had.
【Misaki】
You saying you're in love with another girl now?!
【Masaya】
You're the only one I love, Misaki.
【Misaki】
Ah...!
【Masaya】
It's embarrassing enough without you blushing.
【Misaki】
I-It's your fault for saying something that made me blush!
【Masaya】
You made me say it! When I said you were the only one, I meant... um, I'm not sure how to put this...
I know how I feel, I just can't put it into words.
【Masaya】
Just that you were the only one for me, in a bad way.
【Misaki】
What the hell? Don't be so depurressing.
【Masaya】
It's because how depressed you were was dragging me down, leaving me immobile.
【Misaki】
Okay, I feel bad, but why the hell are you so influenced by how other people feel?
【Masaya】
Because I loved you, obviously!
【Misaki】
Ah...!
【Masaya】
I told you not to blush!
【Misaki】
It's not like I can help it! You're the one who's getting me all hot and bothered!
【Masaya】
Well, anyway, when you told me you didn't want to get back into FC, trying to imagine the future gave me chills.
【Misaki】
You could have just, like, not, y'know? But anyway...
Misaki smiles at me.
【Masaya】
What's up?
【Misaki】
Honestly, I was pretty surprised by how you acted back then.
【Masaya】
I know I said some pretty pathetic things. But then again, you knew I would, didn't you?
【Misaki】
Not like that, it's more... Hm, hahahaha...
【Masaya】
What's with the laugh?
【Misaki】
I was expecting you to just confess your love to me and start kissing me straight away.
【Masaya】
I was doing my best to tell you how I felt, and your mind just jumped straight to sex?
【Misaki】
What does asking someone out and kissing have to do with sex?!
【Masaya】
Good point...
【Misaki】
Yeah! Take this!
【Masked Skywalker】
Ngh! No! Just remain stationary!
【Misaki】
Ughhh! Now that's something I do mind!
Misaki, in the lower position, and Masked Skywalker, in the higher position, are on the field where they've been practicing for quite a while now.
Shirase-san, Prez, and I are looking up at them while we hold a strategy meeting.
【Shirase】
Hm, not quite.
Shirase-san erases the idea he's been writing on the whiteboard and starts again.
【Shion】
Oh? Tobisawa just drew Mask in, used a reversal, and gained the height advantage.
To "draw someone in" in FC terms is to use a feint or something to get your opponent to move down toward you.
It combines well with a reversal.
【Shirase】
A reversal, huh? There's a huge skill gap between Masked Skywalker and Misaki-chan, so she can make it work, but what if she was up against Inui or Asuka-chan? How many times would she be able to attempt it, and then how many times within that would it actually work?
I speak into my headset.
【Masaya】
Return to your positions and go again. No reversals this time.
【Misaki】
Roger!
【Masaya】
Mask, please ensure you don't get drawn in by any feints.
【Masked Skywalker】
Got it.
【Shirase】
Hm, what was Shindou-kun's advice again?
【Masaya】
To fight on a small scale.
【Shirase】
Hm, a small scale. I think I get what he's trying to say, but how do we get a solution out of that?
【Shion】
I wish Shindou had given us the answer straight up instead of this annoying riddle.
【Masaya】
He was just telling me it was something worth considering. I honestly doubt he even has an answer himself. Either way, I'm grateful he's given us a nudge in the right direction.
【Shion】
Hm, let's try getting our thoughts in order. Shirase-san, can I borrow the whiteboard?
【Shirase】
Sure.
Prez proceeds to draw a little figure of Misaki under the figure of Inui that Shirase-san drew.
【Shion】
Inui is hovering above here with Tobisawa here...
【Masaya】
You've got Misaki's limbs the wrong way.
【Shion】
Oh, I got up and down mixed up. I bet Tobisawa could pull this off, though.
【Masaya】
Why would you even assume that? I'm pretty sure she can't dislocate her joints at will...
Shirase-san smiles as he looks at the picture.
【Shirase】
It all makes sense if we just assume Misaki-chan's flying inverted as Inui draws in.
【Masaya/Shion】
...Huh?
【Masaya】
...Huh?
【Shion】
...Huh?
Prez and I look at each other at the exact same time. We're definitely onto something here.
Something good.
【Shion】
Shirase-san, what'd you just say?
【Shirase】
Hm?
He looks confused as he stares over at me and Prez.
【Shirase】
What?
【Masaya】
You just mentioned inverted flight.
【Shirase】
Yeah, but... Oh!
【Masaya】
......
【Shion】
......
【Shirase】
......
We all fall silent.
【Masaya】
Feels like we've got something, right?
【Shion】
Right.
【Shirase】
Inverted flight, huh...? Yeah, inverted flight.
I speak into my headset.
【Masaya】
Misaki, Mask, come down here. There's something we need to discuss.
【Misaki】
Oh, what's up?
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahaha, to the gallows with you!
【Misaki】
Oh, yes. Don't mind if I do.
The two of them have their usual back and forth as they descend.
【Misaki】
'Sup?
【Masaya】
Take a look at this.
I point at the whiteboard.
【Shion】
Inui's on top, Tobisawa's on bottom.
【Misaki】
My limbs are all pointing the wrong direction.
【Masked Skywalker】
This is a vision of you in the future, having been defeated by the Mysterious Masked Skywalker.
【Misaki】
Rude! I haven't done anything to deserve being crippled!
【Masaya】
The figures are of Inui-san and Misaki. You're not even there, Mask.
【Masked Skywalker】
Then allow me to fix it!
【Shion】
Huh?
Masked Skywalker snatches the pen from the president...
【Masked Skywalker】
There. Perfect.
Then, they draw a mask on the upper figure.
【Misaki】
When did me losing become a given?!
【Masked Skywalker】
It is merely a matter of time! To the gallows with you!
【Misaki】
Don't mind if I do!
【Masaya】
Um, anyway... Misaki, this is you flying inverted. What do you think?
【Misaki】
That's not much for me to visualize here...
【Shirase】
Well, none of us are better off, really. We just thought that inverted flight might be the answer.
【Misaki】
The answer? Masaya, what's going on?
【Masaya】
Look... say for instance, you could fly on your back as well as you could do normally. What then?
【Misaki】
...Nothing would change?
Everyone remains silent for about half a minute.
【Shirase】
If you could do that, all of Inui's tactics would be rendered invalid.
【Misaki】
Huh?! Seriously?!
【Shion】
I was just thinking the same thing.
【Misaki】
Huh? Why would that happen?
I take two Mr. Shitous out of my bag. Then, I hold them pointing the same way, heads down to the ground.
【Masaya】
Look here. Inui's tactics revolve around maintaining the height advantage. While above your opponent, it's easy to monitor their actions, but the person below has a difficult time knowing what's going on above. That's where the advantage comes from.
【Misaki】
The upper Mr. Shitou can see the lower Mr. Shitou, but the lower Mr. Shitou can't see the upper Mr. Shitou.
I press the upper Mr. Shitou's face against the back of the lower one.
【Masaya】
Being in the upper position also makes it easier to target your opponent's back in a dogfight. The person below simply has to have their back to their opponent at all times.
【Misaki】
Boy, don't I know it from all this practicing.
【Masaya】
The person in the upper position can also use gravity to help them accelerate, but the person in the lower position has less potential energy, so they can't do it as effectively.
【Misaki】
Yeah, I've been forced to deal with this every single day during practice.
【Masaya】
And so...
I flip the lower Mr. Shitou around.
【Masaya】
Now both players can see each other.
【Misaki】
Huh? Oh, right... Now the lower player can look up, while the upper player keeps on looking down.
I bump the two Mr. Shitous' heads together.
【Masaya】
And if they enter a dogfight while they're both facing each other, they'd be completely equal.
【Misaki】
I see... So basically...
Misaki stares between the Mr. Shitous and the whiteboard before continuing.
【Misaki】
If I can fly inverted, it no longer matters who's above or below?
【Masaya】
With one exception.
【Misaki】
That would be, um... gravity?
【Masaya】
Exactly. The person above still has gravity to their advantage. That'll hold true even during a dogfight, but...
I press the Mr. Shitous together.
【Masaya】
When we consider your specialty is dogfights, gravity's no longer a deciding factor.
Misaki quickly alternates looks between me, Shirase-san, and Prez.
【Misaki】
You mean we've actually found a way to break through Inui-san's tactics?
【Masaya】
Maybe. But there's still a big problem.
Misaki anxiously opens her mouth.
【Misaki】
Which is?
【Shirase】
Inverted flight itself.
【Misaki】
I've never really flown inverted before. Is it difficult?
【Masaya】
I've never done it properly myself, so I dunno...
I turn to Shirase-san.
【Masaya】
There aren't many people who practice inverted flight, right?
【Shirase】
Nope. You can imagine how difficult it is. It may be doable enough for just flying for fun, but during a match is a whole different story.
【Masaya】
Yeah. Maintaining an inverted flight form is probably difficult enough.
【Misaki】
The problems start there? Won't you just get used to it?
【Masaya】
I doubt it's that easy to get used to it.
【Misaki】
I guess...
【Masaya】
The settings on Grav Shoes are set with normal, level flying in mind. The anti-graviton membrane created by the shoes makes it easiest to fly in that position.
【Misaki】
But Grav Shoes have all kinds of settings, yeah? Can't we just tinker with them to line them up with inverted flight?
【Shion】
Do you plan on flying inverted for the entire match?
【Misaki】
...Oh. That's probably not happening.
【Masaya】
Changing the settings on your shoes for inverted flight would make it harder to fly normally.
【Shirase】
Might be interesting to spend the whole match flying inverted. No one's ever even considered an opponent like that, so you might even make it all the way to the national championships.
【Shion】
Hehehehe, this has gotten interesting.
【Masaya】
...Not happening.
【Shirase】
Why not?
【Masaya】
If we put all our eggs in that basket, all it would take is for one player to work out a counter-strategy and we'd be ruined. Besides, you can only fly inverted when you're below your opponent.
【Shirase】
True. After you get the height advantage, you'll just be showing your back to your opponent.
【Shion】
Which means they'll just score one point off you after another... Also, maintaining the lower position would mean you can't use gravity to accelerate as effectively.
【Masaya】
Yeah. It's just more advantageous to fly normally. We may win the first tournament we go to, but that would be the end of it. I want Misaki to be the best player possible.
【Misaki】
......
【Masaya】
Misaki's not the kind of person who'll win one tournament and let things end there.
【Shirase】
That so, Misaki-chan?
【Misaki】
Dunno, you're better off asking my coach.
【Shirase】
I still think having a player specialized in inverted flight is an interesting idea.
【Masked Skywalker】
......
【Misaki】
You gonna do it, Mask?
【Masked Skywalker】
I would not stoop to the level of stealing another's idea.
【Misaki】
Guess I'll give it a go, then.
【Masaya】
The ideal situation has you focusing on normal flying, while being able to break out inverted flight if the need arises.
【Misaki】
But there are still issues with the membrane, right?
【Shion】
Hehehehehe!
【Masaya】
Prez?
【Shion】
If you can't rely on the membrane, just rely on something else.
【Masaya】
Like?
【Misaki】
Oh, you mean...
Prez strikes one of his signature poses.
【Shion】
Muscles! Muscles are wonderful! Muscles are strong! No muscles, no life!
【Misaki】
Who stuck me in the universe where I become a Muscle Sister?!
【Masaya】
Hm, it might be a good idea to train your back muscles and abs to help maintain your form.
【Masked Skywalker】
Train your muscles!
【Misaki】
Isn't anyone gonna save me from a muscley doom?
【Shirase】
Hahaha! Let's not get too hasty here, guys.
【Shirase】
I think we need to test to see if inverted flight really can break through Inui's tactics.
【Masaya】
Better to test out a theory than debate it, huh?
【Misaki】
Aight! Let's get cracking!
【Masaya】
You okay with this, Mask?
【Masked Skywalker】
I'm ready whenever!
【Misaki】
Thanks, dude! I'm seriously so grateful! Thank you, really!
【Masked Skywalker】
Ah...! I simply participate to ensure your defeat at my hands! T-To the gallows with you!
【Misaki】
If it's for you, Mask, I really don't mind!
【Shirase】
Yeah, yeah. Get going, you two.
【Misaki】
Meooooooooooooooow!
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahahahaha!
【Misaki】
Hmmeoooooooooooow!
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahahahaha!
【Misaki】
Skreeeeeeeeeeee!
It's an all-you-can-eat Misaki buffet out there.
【Shion】
She's getting destroyed.
【Masaya】
That's fine, but Mask is being relentless.
【Shirase】
I told them to.
【Masaya】
Huh...? Told them to what?
【Shirase】
To find Misaki-chan's weakness and pursue it relentlessly.
【Masaya】
You really gave that order?
【Shirase】
Mask's not what you'd call mentally strong. Without firm orders, they'll cower in the face of a strong opponent.
【Shion】
All that shouting and grandeur is a way of boosting their courage.
【Masaya】
Oh, I see...
Shindou-san started yelling when playing against Asuka and Inui, too.
I assumed it was a tactic to make his opponents cower, but it seems part of it was to encourage himself as well.
【Masaya】
So that's what Mask's doing?
【Shirase】
Yeah. They're a timid, gentle person at heart. I feel like this might be working <i>too</i> well, though.
【Masaya】
You care a lot about Mask, huh?
【Shirase】
Huh? Y-You think? Pretty sure you're imagining things.
【Masaya】
No, I'm pretty sure I'm not...
【Shion】
Hinata, it would be uncouth to continue here.
【Masaya】
Uh, what?
【Shion】
You know, unsophisticated. That is to say, inelegant. You must never try to figure out the true nature of one who wears a mask.
【Masaya】
...I see.
They're hiding themselves because they want to. I shouldn't be poking my nose into it.
Misaki doesn't have enough practice partners as it is, and it'd be hard to find someone else who'll work this hard.
So that's fine. But still...
【Masaya】
If I ever get the chance to pay Mask back for this, I definitely will.
【Shirase】
Thanks... So, what'll we do about the current issue?
【Masaya】
Let's have them come down for now.
I switch on my headset.
【Masaya】
Come down, you two.
【Misaki】
Hmmeooow!
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahaha!
Misaki is evidently exhausted. She approaches, unsteady on her feet.
【Masaya】
How'd it go?
【Misaki】
I could see more than usual, I guess, so in a way, it made the match easier to play. Also, we were facing each other, so I wasn't worried about my back being targeted.
【Masaya】
Those are some big pluses.
【Misaki】
I think those are the only good points right now, though.
【Masaya】
I'll bet. Things wouldn't have gone so bad up there if you only had good things to say.
【Misaki】
It's terrifying. Having your back to the sea instead of to the sky feels completely different. I thought I was gonna fall into the water at any moment. Also, it's hard to tell how high up you are.
【Masaya】
It is? How so?
【Misaki】
Well... normally, when you're flying, you can see all around you, yeah? Like I just have to turn my neck slightly to see that the beach is over here, and I can see way into the distance too.
【Masaya】
But you can't see that while flying inverted?
【Misaki】
Nope. Can't see a thing. I ain't kiddin' around!
【Masaya】
What's with the sudden Hosaka impression?
【Misaki】
I can't see anything but the sky. It's impossible to tell how high up I am without contorting into some weird angle or twisting the whole way around.
【Masaya】
Makes sense...
When flying normally, you can just tilt your head down to see the ground, but that's impossible when flying inverted.
【Misaki】
All I can see is the sky, the clouds, and the sun.
【Shirase】
So it's hard to tell where you are vertically, but what about horizontally?
【Misaki】
I <i>can</i> see the buoys, but it feels like there's way more angles where I can't see them compared to flying normally.
【Shion】
Couldn't instructions from your second help you work through that?
【Misaki】
Maybe, but like... not being able to tell myself was killing me.
【Misaki】
It'll probably be hard to dogfight without having any sense of distance.
【Masaya】
Right. Was there anything else that bothered you?
【Misaki】
The form, I guess? It made me feel all stiff, so I ended up responding to Mask's movements a moment late.
【Masked Skywalker】
Hehehe! Or perhaps the mask defeated you on raw strength alone?
【Misaki】
You suddenly outpaced me?!
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahaha!
【Shion】
So, what do you two plan on doing?
【Masaya】
As in?
【Shion】
The fall tournament. If you wanna beat Inui there, you're already starting a bit late.
【Shirase】
He's got a point.
【Masaya/Misaki】
......
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
......
Misaki and I look at each other.
【Shirase】
Try out inverted flying, look into other options... or give up on being ready for the fall tournament... Those are your only options.
【Masaya】
...I think it's worth trying out inverted flying. But in the end, the decision's up to Misaki.
【Misaki】
Haaaaaah, it's so perverted of you to say that when you already know what my answer will be.
【Masaya】
What's so perverted about it?
Misaki stares up at me.
【Misaki】
It's perverted that you're getting me to make the decision when you already know there's no way in hell I'll refuse.
【Masked Skywalker】
To the gallows with you!
【Misaki】
Don't mind if I do, Mask! Here's to working together until the fall tournament!
Misaki bows her head.
【Masked Skywalker】
......
Mask is slightly taken aback.
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahaha! You think you can keep up with the mask?!
【Misaki】
I'll do my best.
【Shirase】
Right, that's our goal, then. We've gotta think up some ways to train.
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Misaki】
Yep!
Misaki bounces up as she gives a giant nod.
【Misaki】
I'm so excited!
【Masaya】
You are?
【Misaki】
Yeah! This is the start of something new! We're all in this together! Isn't that awesome?
【Masaya】
Awesome, huh? Yeah, it sure is.
Shindou-san's words cross my mind.
He says we're lucky to be able to play FC while it's still developing.
I didn't doubt that he believed that, but I <i>did</i> think part of him was just trying to act tough.
I thought, maybe he'd convinced himself of that so it didn't feel like all the work he'd put in had been laid to waste by Inui.
But I was wrong.
We're all standing right in the midst of the storm of change, one that we influence ourselves. There's Misaki, there's Mask, there's Shirase-san, there's Prez...
And there's me.
【Masaya】
One thing!
【Shirase】
What's up?
【Shion】
Your face is red.
【Masked Skywalker】
......
【Misaki】
You feeling hungry?
【Masaya】
I'm really glad we have this chance to work together!
My words are completely heartfelt, and yet...
【Shirase】
Hahahahahaha!
【Shion】
Hahahahahaha!
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahahaha!
【Misaki】
Hahahahahahaha!
Everyone erupts with laughter.
As embarrassing as this is, everyone's smiling, so it's not all that bad.
【Misaki】
Ugh!
【Masked Skywalker】
Heh... Not on my watch!
【Misaki】
Here I go!
Misaki throws a feint as she flies inverted below Mask, ascending into a dogfight.
【Masked Skywalker】
Ah...!
【Misaki】
Shit!
Mask touches Misaki's back.
【Shirase】
Mask drew her in perfectly.
【Masaya】
Man, Mask's gotten really good.
【Shirase】
Well, playing against Misaki-chan and going through all those dogfights would help anyone improve. Inverted flight really does dull your reactions though, huh?
【Masaya】
Yeah.
Ten days have passed since we started practicing inverted flight.
Yet Mask is still able to keep Misaki in check and steal points off her.
Things are going pretty well, I think...
But there's one thought constantly running through my mind.
Summer break is almost over.
Is this too much for her to master in such a short time?
【Misaki】
Take this! Haaah, haaah, haaah, mmm!
Misaki's panting and her movements have gotten sloppy. Her concentration is evidently broken.
【Masaya】
Prez, could you switch with Mask?
【Shion】
Ooooookaaaaaay! I'm ready to fly whenever!
I switch on my headset.
【Masaya】
Mask, it's time to descend. Prez is up next. We'll switch to practicing stopping a Speeder.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah... Roger!
【Shirase】
Mask's gotten used to her moves, so they can dodge her attacks, but Inui herself might be too bewildered to do anything at first.
【Masaya】
Maybe...
I know Shirase-san's being considerate here. If Misaki or I end up feeling defeated by how things are going, everything we've done will be for nothing.
But his kindness doesn't help formulate our tactics.
【Masaya】
It's okay, Shirase-san. Neither of us have any plans of giving up now.
【Shirase】
That so? Then I may as well say it. Misaki-chan's not getting the hang of it.
【Masaya】
......
【Shirase】
I kind of figured a genius like her would be able to master this in no time.
【Masaya】
Genius or not, I thought so too.
I think back to that one summer day where I was forced to see a vision of my future self.
How was Misaki able to do that if this is where she stumbles?
We're walking toward Misaki's house.
This area's full of old, historic buildings, making it seem far more refined than the new residential area where I live.
【Misaki】
Haaah, inverted flight is <i>way</i> harder than I thought!
【Masaya】
It's an uphill battle.
【Misaki】
I hate that I still can't do it right. Ugh, I hate it!
【Masaya】
Oh?
【Misaki】
Ugh! I hate it, I hate it, I hate it! To put it in terms you'll understand, I hate this ten times more than when that wild boar ravaged Grandma's field!
【Masaya】
Yeah, not sure I get that.
【Misaki】
I'm just saying I hate this more than you can imagine.
【Masaya】
...Can I ask you something?
【Misaki】
Is it pervy? Honestly, you guys...
【Masaya】
Why would I do that at a time like this?
【Misaki】
Well, there isn't anything else you'd want to ask, is there?
【Masaya】
Of course there is! Tons of stuff!
【Misaki】
<i>Very</i> suspicious. I'm convinced it's a pervy question, but... go ahead.
【Masaya】
It's about that day we first met.
【Misaki】
......
【Masaya】
You were flying even faster than me. Plus, your form was similar to mine, but even more beautiful.
【Misaki】
It was?
【Masaya】
This may be a weird question, but...
I assumed Misaki just happened to get the hang of things quickly, right at the start.
But then, why...
【Masaya】
Why are you only at this level when you were able to do so much in your first match?
【Misaki】
Huh? That's a tough question...
【Masaya】
I was pretty damn strong. How the hell did you manage to fly better than me when you were a beginner? It should've been impossible.
I'm embarrassed to be bringing up the past, but back then, I was good enough to represent Japan on the world stage.
Yet Misaki hadn't even competed in a regional, let alone a national. It's hard to believe she was a beginner.
【Misaki】
Yeah, but it happened, so...
【Masaya】
I get that you're lacking in stamina, but you should have won a national tournament or something by now.
【Misaki】
As if. I mean, obviously that hasn't happened.
【Masaya】
I just don't get it. Your form's still great, so why choose to be a Fighter? Wouldn't you have been better off as a Speeder or All-Rounder?
【Misaki】
Hm, well, I've always liked a good brawl. And when it comes to being a Speeder or an All-Rounder... Honestly, I'm not that confident in my form.
【Masaya】
Huh? I thought you said you could do anything?
【Misaki】
And I can. Like, if I actually tried, I could pull it off decently. But actually being a Speeder or an All-Rounder would be too much for me. Maybe I was just too idealistic in the past.
【Masaya】
Idealistic about what?
【Misaki】
It's 'cause you got the wrong idea, Masaya... You never tried to understand how I felt, so I never got a chance to tell you.
【Masaya】
Wrong idea about what? Weren't you just flying for fun?
Misaki forces a small smile.
【Misaki】
Half of me was. The other half of me was disappointed.
【Masaya】
About what?
【Misaki】
Remember how you suddenly quit on me? I thought you were angry 'cause of how bad I was.
【Misaki】
I went to the beach every day while I was staying at Grandma's house, hoping I'd get a chance to apologize to you.
【Masaya】
You did? Oh, I, uh... I'm sorry.
【Misaki】
I thought you were angry because my form was awful.
She forced herself to adopt another style.
【Misaki】
So I also thought it was better to not play as a Speeder.
【Masaya】
I don't really know what to say... I'm sorry.
I truly mean that. I just hope it can fix things after all this time.
【Misaki】
I'm the one who should be apologizing. Besides, there was another reason I couldn't be a Speeder or All-Rounder.
【Masaya】
What do you mean?
【Misaki】
If I really was flying that well, then it was 'cause you were next to me, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Maybe, but there are tons of people better than me. You can go online and see hundreds of videos.
【Misaki】
That wouldn't help. I wanted to feel it in person, to see it and smell it. I get the feeling that's what helps me grow.
【Masaya】
So that means...
【Misaki】
Hm?
【Masaya】
You've never met anyone better than me, and that's why you're still at the same level?
【Misaki】
I object to you implying I'm still at the <i>exact</i> same level... But I never met anyone else quite like you, Masaya.
So that's it, huh?
Lines are starting to form in my head between problems that I'd never really spared much thought.
Maybe the basis for Misaki's shock was that she was using tactics she couldn't comprehend simply by watching.
Sure, it might have been <i>surprising</i> if she'd been able to fly at insane speeds, or take insanely tight turns, or pull off insane Aileron Rolls, or do insanely fast Low Yo-Yos...
But that wouldn't have been enough to make her consider quitting FC.
You can't understand Inui's tactics simply by watching. You have to develop a mind for FC first.
That's what left Misaki in so much shock.
On top of that, she had to deal with the shock of Asuka readily understanding something she couldn't herself.
And then there's one more problem. The reason she's progressing slower with inverted flight than she expected.
She's never seen it before. Of course she hasn't. Tons of players end up flying inverted over the course of a match, but no one puts themselves in that position voluntarily.
She has no model to imitate, and that leaves her progressing at the same rate as any normal person.
That's okay, though. More than okay, actually.
【Misaki】
I'm sorry I've disappointed you by not being able to pull off inverted flight.
【Masaya】
I think it's a good thing.
【Misaki】
Why?
【Masaya】
Because you won't forget something that you put in hard work and effort to master.
【Misaki】
You think?
【Masaya】
A technique that you put in the effort to learn sticks with you way longer than one you learn instantly. It's far more ingrained in you. There's a mental aspect to it, too. It gives you the confidence to win with what you've learned.
【Misaki】
I see. Not sure I'm putting in quite as much effort as you're saying, though.
【Masaya】
But you are. I'm the one who's making you stop practicing at the end of the day. If I left you alone, you'd probably keep going until the sun went down.
【Misaki】
I wouldn't last that long... It only takes about three minutes from the start of practice before I'm going, "God, I can't take it" over and over in my head.
【Masaya】
But I'm still the one stopping you, so that you don't overwork yourself. Listen, you should know you're putting in a <i>ton</i> of work, okay?
【Misaki】
I-If you say so, Masaya.
Misaki goes strangely silent, then comes to a halt.
【Misaki】
You can leave me here. I'll be fine on my own the rest of the way.
【Masaya】
I'll see you back to your house.
【Misaki】
Nah, it's cool. I wanna be alone for a bit. Besides, if Grandma sees you, she'll get all like, "Why don't you introduce me to your <i>boyfriend,</i>" y'know?
【Masaya】
You could introduce me, though?
【Misaki】
No way! I've got a lot of building up to do before I'm ready for that. Here's fine for today.
【Masaya】
Okay. See you later.
【Misaki】
Bye!
Misaki waves me off before spinning around and walking right off.
I have dinner, take a bath, then start looking up the latest FC news online.
Inui's tactics still aren't proving to be much of a topic of conversation.
It seems that out of all the people in the audience, very few experienced the same shock as us.
That match between Inui and Shindou-san...
From a normal perspective, it just looked like Inui kept him in check the whole time and won that way.
But I imagine more people will realize that's not the case in the next tournament.
【Masaya】
The change in FC might all come from Shitou Island, huh?
As I gaze blankly at my monitor, my phone starts to ring on my desk.
Misaki's calling.
【Masaya】
What's up? Something wrong?
【Misaki】
Um...
【Masaya】
Hm?
【Misaki】
I was wondering if you could come meet me.
【Masaya】
Now? This late?
【Misaki】
I wanna see you. Though not for any pervy reasons. Are you disappointed?
【Masaya】
<i>Totally.</i> It really gets your hopes up when a girl rings to tell you they wanna see you this late at night.
【Misaki】
Wow, you're <i>actually</i> being honest!
【Masaya】
So, why do you wanna see me?
【Misaki】
Truth is... my body's burning up.
【Masaya】
Hm? So this is about sex?
【Misaki】
No!
【Masaya】
What then?
【Misaki】
I wanna fly!
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Misaki】
I just really wanna fly, and I want you to watch me. Please, don't say no.
【Masaya】
...Okay.
【Misaki】
You gave in easily.
【Masaya】
And you told me not to say no. Besides, I used to do this all the time back in the day.
I'd jump up in the dead of night and start flying. Even if I'd been told to stop practicing, I just kept going alone.
My entire being was FC, and I couldn't be stopped.
【Masaya】
Okay, I'll come meet you at your place. Girls shouldn't be out alone this late at night.
I set up the buoys, then stare up at the beautiful moon hanging in the night sky.
【Masaya】
I feel uneasy.
The clubroom door gives its usual weird creak as Misaki steps out, changed into her practice gear.
【Misaki】
Feels like I'm doing something I shouldn't be, changing in the clubroom.
【Masaya】
I know what you mean.
This is a place we abandoned. I know everyone would be more than happy to welcome us back, but it still feels like we don't belong here.
【Masaya】
We'd stand out way too much if we flew over at the beach.
Worst outcome would be someone reporting us to the police, which would end with us being arrested, and then suspended from school.
【Masaya】
We don't have to worry here, though. The cliffs stop people from being able to see.
Misaki stretches out wide.
【Misaki】
Aight, may as well get to flying. Haven't flown out here in a while.
【Masaya】
Start off slow.
【Misaki】
I know, I know.
Misaki activates her Grav Shoes and flies toward the field.
【Misaki】
Man, flying at night is real scary.
【Masaya】
I'm watching you, don't worry.
The moonlight helps me take in Misaki's form.
【Misaki】
I trust you. I'm gonna warm up, then do some inverted flying.
【Masaya】
Not yet! Keep those Low Yo-Yos sharp on the descent! Don't be afraid!
【Misaki】
Ah...! I'm telling you I'm afraid of plunging into the water!
【Masaya】
If you keep this up, you'll never get anywhere!
【Misaki】
Ugh!
Misaki drops down in the night sky as she flies on her back.
Her steep descent turns into a steep ascent. We're practicing sharp-angled Low Yo-Yos.
【Masaya】
If you can't get this done, you'll never be able to fly!
【Misaki】
That's not fair! Why are you being so much harsher than earlier?
【Masaya】
'Cause I get the feeling you're in the mood for it?
【Misaki】
I am in the mood for it! Haaah!
We need to increase the precision of her Low Yo-Yos, High Yo-Yos, and Scissors. That's the only way she'll perfect inverted flight.
【Masaya】
Now, do a High Yo-Yo!
【Misaki】
Ugh, aaah!
【Masaya】
Your reactions are slow! You're taking a moment to think after I give my orders.
【Misaki】
Yeah, 'cause I have to do the exact opposite of what I do when flying normally! It's hard!
【Masaya】
Well, you better ingrain it into your body so it doesn't take a moment! No back talk, just do it!
【Misaki】
I'm gonna trust you and do as you say, but I reserve the right to back talk!
She sure is a confusing girl.
【Masaya】
Fine, do as I say and you can complain all you want. Do the Scissors! Too slow! Just wiggling your ass around doesn't count as bending!
【Misaki】
Ugh! Shuddup, shuddup, shuddup!
【Masaya】
Come on, do the Scissors again! Too slow! At this rate, both Inui and Asuka will beat you. I thought you didn't want to lose!
【Misaki】
I don't wanna lose! I don't wanna lose! I don't wanna lose! I've come so far! If I lose now, then I don't know what I'll do with myself!
【Masaya】
Then put your back into it!
【Misaki】
My back is in it!
【Masaya】
Speed up! Faster!
【Misaki】
It's not that I hate Asuka! I like her! I don't hate Inui-san either!
【Masaya】
I know.
【Misaki】
I just... I just don't wanna lose! If I lose... If I lose, I think I'll lose everything. I'm scared. That's all it is.
【Masaya】
I know. Faster!
【Misaki】
Meooooooooooooooow!
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah!
【Masaya】
Don't stop! Go! Fly on your back and touch that buoy!
【Misaki】
Meooow! Ah!
She tries to check where the buoy is as she moves toward it, so the recoil from the impact sends her flying outside of the field.
【Masaya】
Don't stop! Get back! I thought I told you not to stop! Have you gone deaf?!
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah... I know already!
She's at her limit.
She's fatigued in both body and soul. Normally, I'd force her to rest.
But not today... We're not stopping until she wants to.
There are some things you can only learn through times of extreme practice, and that time has come for Misaki.
Of course, I can't promise she'll learn anything here, but...
Well, there's a world you can only see at the very extremes of exhaustion.
Whether that's meaningful or not, however, is up to fate.
You just don't know until you try. But for now...
【Masaya】
If you don't do this now, I'll never let you practice like this again! Have you already lost the will to fly?!
【Misaki】
I wanna fly, I do, I do! I <i>can</i> fly! Haaah, haaah, haaah... What's next?! Gimme more orders already!
【Masaya】
Next...
Go! Fly!
【Masaya】
Accelerate!
Faster!
【Misaki】
Meoooooooooooow!
The moon begins to wane as Misaki's yell contorts into a shriek that pierces the night's sky.
【Misaki】
Ah, mm, haaah, ah...
She must be at her limit now, right?
I must admit, I didn't think Misaki had this much in her.
She used to hate practice so much... She really is determined this time.
Tears threaten to well up in my eyes.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah!
But I know that's not all. That's just one of many reasons she has to fly.
One of the others is...
To save me.
That's why she's pushing herself so hard.
I really am gonna cry now.
But I know I have to fight back my tears. I can't show her weakness now. A coach's weakness is easily moved onto their players.
So instead, I encourage her.
【Masaya】
Go! You can do this! I know you've got more in you!
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, I can do dish!
【Masaya】
Then touch that buoy and accelerate!
【Misaki】
Yesshir!
Huh?
I thought she'd be repelled by the buoy. It's happened countless times already.
She's worn out and can't move the way she wants to.
Misaki's arm extends with an almost eerie smoothness... She touches the buoy and moves naturally into acceleration.
【Misaki】
...Huh?
Her line is straight with no bends in sight.
She's accelerating pretty fast, too.
【Masaya】
No slacking! Go into a Low Yo-Yo!
【Misaki】
Ah...!
No way...
Misaki shoots straight down, again in a perfect line.
【Masaya】
Misaki!
【Misaki】
Yes! My body's moving how I want it to. I'm doing it, Masaya! I'm moving without even having to think! My mind just went blank!
【Masaya】
Awesome, that's great. You only need to use your brain when you need to survey the entire game. When you just need to move, it can be as blank as you like.
If anything, it's better blank. Your head is for understanding the situation. Your body is for taking that understanding and flying accordingly.
【Misaki】
This is... so sudden. Haha! Hahahahahaha!
I feel my entire body relax upon hearing Misaki laugh. My shoulders, which had tensed up without me realizing, drop down casually. The weight of the world has finally been lifted off me.
【Masaya】
These things happen. You did it, Misaki.
【Misaki】
I did...
【Masaya】
Yep!
【Misaki】
Haha, hahahahahahahaha! Go, me! I did it! These things <i>do</i> happen! Yay! This is amazing! <i>I'm</i> amazing!
【Masaya】
You really are amazing, Misaki. You're a genius.
【Misaki】
You called me a genius!
【Masaya】
Right now, at least.
【Misaki】
Hahahahaha, that's more than good enough for me.
The underlying theory here is that fatigue has left her unable to think, and also unable to consciously exert herself.
This happens because a person's body will cut down its use of non-critical functions when they're in a fatigue state. It does this so it can try and maintain use of functions necessary to survive.
At times like this, your mind and body become one. All unnecessary movements are reduced, allowing you to act smoothly. Any extraneous force is removed. Erased.
It's not easy to forget something you learn in this way, similar to how one will never forget how to ride a bicycle.
【Masaya】
Great work, Misaki. You must be exhausted. Come back down.
【Misaki】
No.
【Masaya】
Why not?
【Misaki】
I'm scared that if I stop now, I'll forget how to do this, so I'm gonna fly a little more.
【Masaya】
Fine, fly until you feel comfortable with it.
【Misaki】
'Kay!
Misaki continues to fly around the field on her back.
Now we can put up a fight.
I'm excited. I might be able to get Misaki to where I promised I would.
I feel a smile forming on my face.
But... what will happen to me when she makes it?
A strange feeling of anxiety is swirling in my chest. It's a dark blob that goes round and round and round.
My smile vanishes. I can feel my face stiffening up.
Why?
I avert my eyes.
"I don't need to face this feeling."
I persuade myself.
There's no need to look at it. Wipe it out.
Misaki turns off her Grav Shoes and lands on the ground.
【Misaki】
Phew...
【Masaya】
Good work out there. You did <i>really</i> well.
【Misaki】
I need to get changed. I worked up a sweat out there.
【Masaya】
Cool. Come on, get inside.
I open the clubroom door and urge Misaki to enter.
【Misaki】
I'm getting changed, so come in, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Hm? Did you forget how language works again?
Maybe the fatigue's made her forget the existence of negatives.
【Misaki】
Just come with me already.
【Masaya】
Why?
【Misaki】
Just do it!
【Masaya】
Okay. I said okay. Wait, don't pull me!
Misaki drags me by the arm into the clubroom.
【Misaki】
Thanks for coming out here tonight.
【Masaya】
No, I should be thanking you.
【Misaki】
Don't be silly. I was the one being selfish.
【Masaya】
But you produced the results here, Misaki.
【Misaki】
But you're the one who pushed me to do it, Masaya, so-- Wait, this isn't what I wanted...
【Masaya】
H-Huh?
【Misaki】
......
Misaki suddenly starts to strip her practice gear.
【Misaki】
Eat this!
【Masked Skywalker】
Ngh! Ngh! Ngh!
【Misaki】
I'm going that way... Psyche!
【Masked Skywalker】
Ah!
【Masaya/Shirase/Shion】
Wow!
【Masaya】
Wow!
【Shirase】
Wow!
【Shion】
Wow!
We all cry out.
That was beautiful. Misaki managed to easily pull a whole meter apart from Masked Skywalker.
It's proof that she has them in the palm of her hand now.
【Masaya】
That was great. Return to your positions and take it from the top.
【Misaki】
Roger!
【Masked Skywalker】
Ngh!
【Masaya】
Also, Misaki, use that FC mind of yours. This is your first time putting these tactics into practice. Let's see you throwing in feints and other tricks, too.
【Misaki】
Will do!
Misaki's voice resounds through the headset.
【Shirase】
She's really got the hang of inverted flying.
【Masaya】
Yeah, it's completely different from how she was at first. Still, it's exhausting work that tends to leave her unstable by the end, so I think she needs to train her back muscles and abs more.
【Shion】
You can leave that to me. I've set up a training regime that'll have her ripped in no time.
【Masaya】
Thanks, man.
【Shirase】
I'm sure you've already realized, but...
【Masaya】
What's that?
【Shirase】
She's working within a small frame.
【Masaya】
Yeah.
The Mysterious Masked Skywalker's trying to keep the pressure up like they have done in all the prior sessions. That is, closing in from above Misaki while blocking her escape routes.
Until this point, Misaki's always ended up pressed down to water level, unable to do anything, or launched into a reckless assault that sees her easily deflected.
However, her inverted flight allows her to ignore the pressure from Masked Skywalker and assert her dominance.
【Masaya】
Flying inverted against a player trying to keep the height advantage has you drawing in close and exerting pressure on each other. It ends up bringing the match down to a small scale.
【Shion】
And that's perfect for Tobisawa.
【Masaya】
Yeah... Oh!
Masked Skywalker abruptly launches forward. Misaki responds in kind.
【Masked Skywalker】
Don't think that'll work out every time!
【Misaki】
Huh?
Masked Skywalker arches backward and pushes their legs out, leaving them flying vertically.
【Misaki】
What?!
Misaki rises into the space previously occupied by Masked Skywalker's upper body. They drew her in perfectly with that feint.
She got cocky, so there goes her balance.
Maybe she was too excited over her progress and got ahead of herself?
Masked Skywalker may have drawn Misaki in, but they'll need to rotate around to her back in order to touch it.
How do they plan on pulling that off?
【Masked Skywalker】
Got you!
【Shion】
Oh, interesting.
Masked Skywalker begins to pull down as Misaki heads on up.
They're pulling into a Low Yo-Yo.
Giving away the height advantage to target the buoy.
【Misaki】
Perfect!
【Masked Skywalker】
Huh?!
Misaki touches Masked Skywalker's back.
【Masaya】
Nice!
My impressions leave my mouth before I can even register them.
Masked Skywalker was tricked by Misaki.
As she claimed the height advantage, they'd pulled into a Low Yo-Yo toward the buoy.
Misaki had twisted into a forward roll while ascending, returning to normal flight and pulling into a Low Yo-Yo of her own.
As a Fighter, her initial velocity is much greater than Masked Skywalker's, allowing her to easily touch their exposed back.
【Shion】
That just now was the result of her drawing Mask into a smaller frame... Tobisawa's pretty incredible, huh?
【Masaya】
She is incredible. Her chances of getting points are way higher now than at the start.
【Shirase】
That was an irregular Angelic Halo she pulled off. Well, in theory, anyway.
【Masaya】
An Angelic Halo... Yeah, I see where you're coming from.
【Shion】
Angelic? What's that?
【Masaya】
A really bizarre move that Aoi-san used on the world stage. You fly at ultra-high speeds in rings around your opponent to stop them from being able to move. It's way too hard for most Skywalkers to pull off.
It allows you to completely dominate your opponent, so it should be effective against Inui's playstyle.
Though that's the reason Aoi-san abandoned that technique. I doubt I'll ever see it in action again.
【Shirase】
It's way easier to pull off... but in theory, they're similar.
【Masaya】
Yeah, I think so.
Without the contrails from your shoes dazzling your opponent, you don't inspire the same levels of fear.
I doubt you'd have much of a chance of winning if you encountered someone using that technique.
However, inverted flight is far more usable than the Angelic Halo is.
【Shirase】
Trapping someone inside a small frame... packaging them up... making them fit your mold... How about Super Package Mold?
【Shion】
Mhm!
【Masaya】
Uh, I'm not so sure about that one...
I speak into my headset.
【Masaya】
Hey, so Shirase-san just suggested we call that fighting style of yours "Super Package Mold." Thoughts?
【Misaki】
Super Package Mold... Sounds kinda lame to me?
【Masked Skywalker】
It's a brilliant name!
【Misaki】
M-Mask?
【Masked Skywalker】
We can call it SuMo for short. It suits you perfectly!
【Misaki】
You think the name SuMo fits me? Wh-What do you mean?
【Masked Skywalker】
...Don't you worry, there are tons of cute sumos out there.
【Misaki】
But I'm not that fat... I mean, I'm not fat at all!
【Masked Skywalker】
Your special move is the SuMo!
【Misaki】
If Mask likes it, then it's fine by me!
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahahaha!
【Masaya】
Looks like we're gonna make it in time for the fall tournament.
【Misaki】
...Yeah. Yeah, we will. Thank you, Masaya. I've gotta thank everyone else, too.
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Misaki】
Ah...
【Masaya】
......
Misaki looks up into the sky as she flies.
She's flying inverted, so I can't see her face.
I wonder what kind of expression she has?
【Misaki】
Hahahahaha!
【Masaya】
What's up?
【Misaki】
Just wondering if we'll get lucky enough for a meteorite to fall and mess up the tournament area without killing anyone.
【Masaya】
This again?! Cut it out!
【Misaki】
We made it in time. Now I've lost another of my excuses.
【Masaya】
Look...
【Misaki】
I'm gonna win. I'm gonna win for myself, for you, and for everyone who's helped. I <i>have to</i> win!
【Masaya】
Yeah, you're gonna win.
【Misaki】
If I lose, I'll be so depressed that I'll die. But if I'm depressed, I'm just, well, depressed.
【Masaya】
Yeah.
That's what she's afraid of, though.
She's worked so hard for so long, but that could all come crashing down around her at the tournament. The winner could be determined before they even step out on the field.
So just how much resolve has gone into Misaki declaring that she's going to win?
Just imagining how she must feel has me breaking out in goosebumps.
【Misaki】
I'm gonna win the fall tournament!
Misaki cries up to the sky.
Today's the opening ceremony.
I feel awkward. Asuka and Madoka may already be in the classroom.
I should just treat them normally, right?
But I feel guilty, like I've betrayed everyone.
There's a dull pain in my gut.
The moment I open the door...
【Asuka】
Oh.
I lock eyes with Asuka.
【Masaya】
G-Good morning...
【Asuka】
Good morning!
Asuka comes trotting over to me.
【Asuka】
Has Misaki-chan gotten stronger?
She gets straight to it.
【Masaya】
...I think so.
【Asuka】
Great, then you kept the promise we made.
【Masaya】
Yeah, I think so... But you could just ask Misaki her-- Oh...
Asuka forces a smile.
【Asuka】
Misaki-chan's been like that the whole time.
She's laying prostrate on her desk.
【Misaki】
Meow, zzzmeow. Mmm, mmm, aaah...
She's sleeping peacefully.
【Mashiro】
Misaki-senpai! Gosh, Misaki-senpai! I haven't seen you in a while, so I wanted to hug you and squeeze you and all kinds of other things! Why are you asleep?! Please wake up and pay attention to me!
【Madoka】
Not a chance. This is her natural state in the mornings.
【Mashiro】
I know that much. I've only got one option left...
【Masaya】
Which is...?
【Mashiro】
Chocolate, duh! I just have to wave it in front of her nose and she'll wake right up. Here, Misaki-senpai, have some--
【Misaki】
Mmm!
Misaki suddenly opens her mouth wide and gobbles up the piece of chocolate Mashiro was holding like a carnivorous fish that's been lying in wait.
【Mashiro】
......
【Misaki】
Meow, meow... Mmm... Zzz, zzz, zzz...
【Madoka】
...She's asleep.
【Mashiro】
Th-Then I'll just have to give her all of the snacks I have on hand. If they run out, I'll just call home and get a delivery.
【Masaya】
Don't force feed the girl. I'm trying to keep her from eating candy outside of when she needs stress relief.
【Mashiro】
Oh, the cheater.
【Masaya】
Since when am I a cheater?
【Mashiro】
Because everything you do is unfair! You got Misaki-senpai to yourself the whooole summer break! I'm so jealous that I'm feeling dizzy.
【Masaya】
I didn't have her all to myself. A bunch of other people helped us practice.
【Madoka】
I know my brother went to help you. He was really pumped, saying he couldn't refuse a request from Hinata.
【Asuka】
O-Oh my, Coach and Prez are in that sort of--
【Masaya】
We're not in "that sort of" anything.
【Mashiro】
It would be fine if you were.
【Asuka】
Exciting, too!
【Masaya】
Give it a break. I respect him and I'm very grateful to him, that's all.
I really am in awe of how he values my opinion, even though I'm younger than him, and how he's beyond caring about simply winning or losing in competitions.
【Masaya】
I'm pretty sure I'd come running too if Prez asked me for help. That's just how it is.
【Mashiro】
Whoa! I'm not even slightly interested in that stuff, but the way you said that totally set my maiden sensor off.
Asuka enthusiastically nods.
【Asuka】
Yeah, mine... was set off.
【Madoka】
It was? What's a little sister to do in this situation...?
【Mashiro】
Anyway, I'm asking what you were thinking! How dare you monopolize Misaki-senpai's entire summer vacation?!
【Masaya】
I mean...
【Mashiro】
Ughhhhhh!
【Masaya】
Misaki saved me, so I just wanted to pay her back for all she's done.
【Asuka】
Um, what do you mean?
【Masaya】
Well, like... Misaki and I are kind of similar. It's like... we both found ourselves unable to move forward, so I wanted to save her, and to be saved myself.
【Mashiro】
Hm?
【Madoka】
So in short, you've fallen in love with Misaki?
【Masaya】
Don't sum it up like that!
Asuka's hand shoots into the air.
【Asuka】
I know exactly what to do at a time like this!
【Madoka】
Wh-What's she gonna say?!
【Asuka】
You know, the "fweet fwooh" thing!
【Madoka】
That's it! Ancient, but still stylish.
【Masaya】
Uh, sure?
It is kind of impressive that Asuka can be so bold despite doing something so embarrassing.
【Masaya】
Why didn't you ever come to see Misaki, Mashiro?
It would've been easy enough to figure out where we were practicing. If anything, she could have at least called.
【Mashiro】
Misaki-senpai told me not to.
【Masaya】
She did? Why?
【Misaki】
Meow, mmm, meooow...
Mashiro stares down at Misaki as she sleeps.
【Mashiro】
She told me over the phone. She said I would've ended up spoiling her if I went.
【Masaya】
......
【Mashiro】
She made it painfully clear by calling me instead of texting. It felt like I'd be getting in the way, so I didn't go.
【Asuka】
You would've spoiled her? I can understand that. You do seem like the type, Mashiro-chan.
【Mashiro】
R-Really? But I'm younger than you...
【Asuka】
That has nothing to do with it. You're a very reliable girl.
【Madoka】
Yeah. Feels like you've experienced all the sweet and bitter things life has to throw at you.
【Mashiro】
I have not!
Mashiro squishes her cheek against Misaki's back.
【Mashiro】
Summer vacation's over now, so I can finally spoil her all I want!
So that's what happened.
I never doubted her, but it seems Misaki made up her mind to practice hard from the very start.
【Misaki】
Meooow, meoooooow, mmm, mmm...
Misaki continues dozing, seemingly ignoring Mashiro's assault.
【Mashiro】
I was so lonely without you coming to eat our udon.
【Masaya】
Hold up, Misaki didn't even eat any udon?
【Mashiro】
No. She said that if she started, she wouldn't be able to stop.
Wow, really?
She never even mentioned it, so I forgot all about her favorite indulgence.
Man, that's amazing.
I mean, it must've taken a lot out of her and all...
We have about three weeks until the fall tournament.
How far will Misaki climb? If she gets where she needs to...
What'll happen to me?
That dark, sticky whatever that's within me seems to be creeping outward.
I'm called to the staff room after class.
Aoi-san, seeming no different from usual, immediately assails me with questions.
【Aoi】
How did focusing on being Tobisawa's coach go?
【Masaya】
You lied to me, Aoi-san.
【Aoi】
What are you talking about?
【Masaya】
You told me Misaki wasn't a genius.
【Aoi】
Heh... So is she, then?
【Masaya】
I think so. A full-blown one at that.
【Aoi】
In what way?
【Masaya】
First of all, her reflexes are first class.
【Aoi】
True. But if that's all it takes to be a genius, wouldn't that make everyone aiming to be a pro Skywalker a genius?
【Masaya】
That's not all, though. Misaki works harder than anyone, <i>and</i> produces results. That's why she's a genius.
【Aoi】
I see... You realize what this means Masaya, don't you?
【Masaya】
What?
【Aoi】
You turned Tobisawa into a genius.
【Masaya】
Huh...?! You're wrong. Misaki's just incredible.
【Aoi】
Either way works. What came first, the chicken or the egg?
【Aoi】
If you say she's a genius, then a genius she is. But... I think Kurashina is even better.
【Masaya】
Maybe.
【Aoi】
I'm sure she would've grown even more if you'd coached her.
【Masaya】
Doubt it. You're a <i>way</i> better coach than me.
【Aoi】
No matter what I do, I'll always be her superior. I can't see things from the same perspective as you.
【Aoi】
Though, the students did help me out there.
【Masaya】
Asuka must've gotten pretty strong.
【Aoi】
She has. What would you say to a practice match between her and Tobisawa?
【Masaya】
......
【Aoi】
Don't you want to see it?
【Masaya】
I do... But I'll have to refuse.
【Aoi】
Why?
【Masaya】
Misaki's focused on the fall tournament. Her concentration would break if she had a match against Asuka now. Winning or losing doesn't matter, it won't be a good result.
【Aoi】
I'm sure Kurashina would jump at the opportunity.
【Masaya】
Don't try and tempt me. Everyone works differently, that's all there is to it.
【Masaya】
You're not gonna change my mind.
Aoi-san's eyes widen as she stares at me.
【Aoi】
Haha, hahahaha!
【Masaya】
What's so funny?
【Aoi】
Oh, just thinking you've really grown up. You pass, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Aoi】
You make a fine coach. The very first thing a good coach needs to be able to do is understand their players.
【Aoi】
If you'd readily agreed to my proposal, I would have been disappointed.
【Masaya】
God, give it a rest already.
【Aoi】
Heh, my bad... You really have grown, though.
【Masaya】
...Thank you.
【Aoi】
I'm looking forward to the fall tournament.
【Masaya】
Same here!
I say that as I bow to her.
【Masaya】
If you shift into inverted flight now, how do you think your opponent will respond?
【Misaki】
We'd probably end up observing each other?
We're spending today doing Mr. Shitou simulation training in Misaki's room.
Honestly, we should be taking a break from practice, but Misaki insisted that she couldn't sit around doing nothing with the fall tournament only a week away.
That said, rest is still important, so we settled for simulation training.
【Masaya】
Huh, someone actually does that? While they're waiting, I'll snatch the buoy!
【Misaki】
Not to worry! Bam! Shadow Clone Jutsu!
【Masaya】
Mr. Shitou split in two!
【Misaki】
One more time!
【Masaya】
Now there are three of him?!
【Misaki】
Positioning? Who cares! Two of them block your path, while the third wooshes around the field touching buoys and racking up points!
【Masaya】
Just because you're tired doesn't mean you can make a mess of things!
【Masaya】
...Actually, where'd you even get those Mr. Shitous? Been playing the crane games?
【Misaki】
From the garbage can in the arcade. I think some people only got him to satisfy their hunting instincts, then realized they didn't need him and threw him away.
【Misaki】
I felt sorry for him, so I decided to take him home.
【Masaya】
Poor Mr. Shitou...
【Misaki】
Right? He's pretty cute if you look close enough... Hey, y'know...
【Masaya】
What's with the sudden tone shift?
【Misaki】
Y'know, Grandma's not home right now.
【Masaya】
Right...
【Misaki】
You squirmed. You <i>totally</i> just squirmed!
【Masaya】
Did not!
【Misaki】
Police! We've got a squirmer over here!
【Masaya】
Don't call the cops on me! How is looking at your girlfriend and squirming a crime?
【Misaki】
This guy won't stop claiming he's my boyfriend!
【Masaya】
I'm pretending now?!
【Misaki】
Don't they say you shouldn't... y'know... before a match?
【Masaya】
Some people say there are actual reasons for it, some say it's all just superstition. I don't really know.
【Misaki】
This tournament is really important, so even if it's just superstition, maybe we shouldn't.
【Masaya】
It'd suck to feel like we lost because we fooled around beforehand.
Though I really don't know if there's any truth to it.
The woman who dominated FC in Europe recently was said to be with her fiancé 24/7, so I imagine they had some fun before her matches.
She was still demonically strong, so it probably depends on your outlook.
【Misaki】
So I had a thought. We'll probably wanna fool around anyway, so why not make today the last time before the tournament?
【Masaya】
O-Okay.
【Misaki】
......
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
Assuming that we're gonna do something, what would you like? I'm down for anything. I'm in the mood for whatever you want to do today... Ah!
I pick Misaki up and place her on the bed.
This leaves her sitting on the bed, which I also climb before positioning myself between her legs.
【Misaki】
Y-You're being kinda aggressive today, Masaya-san.
【Masaya】
You think I have a choice after what you just said?
【Misaki】
I dunno, I'm not you... So, what do you plan to do now?
Misaki sighs as she looks up at the sky near the field.
【Misaki】
Haaah, it's finally time, huh?
【Masaya】
It sure is.
The fall tournament has finally begun.
I met up with Misaki this morning, and she dragged her heels over to the tournament site.
We could've come with the rest of Kunahama, but I decided it was best for Misaki that we didn't.
She may end up facing Asuka or Mashiro in the tournament, after all.
Honestly, there's a pretty high chance she'll end up facing Asuka at some point.
Misaki and Asuka seem fine when they talk during class, so maybe I'm just worrying too much...
Well, whatever. I just think it's best they don't see each other on the day of the match.
No matter how the two of them feel, it's difficult to play against someone you know.
The fall tournament is primarily for newcomers, so it gets less participants than the summer tournament. However, TV channels still comes to film it, and it gets a pretty large audience overall.
Shitou has the highest level of FC play in all of Japan. It's no wonder our tournaments are so popular. People even come from abroad to see them.
It's probably gonna be just as lively as the summer tournament.
Misaki's ignoring the noisy tournament area, staring off into the horizon.
【Misaki】
The fall tournament, huh?
【Masaya】
It still feels like summer all the way through September on Shitou, so it feels more like round two of the summer tournament than a fall one.
【Misaki】
Yeah.
Misaki gives me that casual reply as she continues to look out over the horizon.
【Masaya】
...What's up? You concentrating?
Some players prefer to play games or something before a match to try and help them relax, but you'll find many who scrunch up their brow, shut their eyes, and focus on getting into the right mindset as well.
【Misaki】
Not really...
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
Just wondering if a giant monster's gonna rise up out of the sea and force them to call off the tournament.
【Masaya】
You're still going on about that?!
Dammit!
【Misaki】
I can't help it! I'm scared!
【Masaya】
Well, at least you can admit to being scared now.
【Misaki】
What do you mean?
【Masaya】
Normally, you just try and act tough. I've never heard you say you're afraid to face what's coming.
【Misaki】
Really?
【Masaya】
Yes, really. If things were going real bad, then I know admitting to it would just make you get even worse. You're composed right now.
【Misaki】
No way, I'm not composed at all!
【Masaya】
If you can make that face while you say that, you're in perfect condition.
【Misaki】
Grrr, you're not making any sense.
【Masaya】
More sense than your talk of monsters, meteorites, and UFOs. Anyway, let's go look at the tournament schedule.
【Misaki】
Seriously, why do they do that in the most nervewracking way possible?! Who the hell announces the matches on the day of the tournament?! Just do it in advance to help people get in the right mindset!
【Masaya】
No use complaining to me about it. Come on, let's go.
【Misaki】
I don't wanna! I don't wanna go! Why can't you just take a look for me? Yeah, great idea, me!
【Masaya】
There's no point if you're not there! Get a move on.
【Misaki】
I have a bad feeling about this. A <i>reaaally</i> bad feeling.
I urge Misaki, who's grumbling more than usual due to her nerves, toward the main office where the tournament schedule is posted.
【Rika】
Ah...
【Misaki】
Huh? Don't tell me...?
【Rika】
Pretty big deal, huh?
【Misaki】
So I <i>am</i> facing you first, Ichinose-chan?! Is whoever makes these taking their job seriously? This is just a repeat of the last tournament!
【Rika】
O-Oh no, we're not playing against each other in the first round. Have you not looked yet?
【Masaya】
We're just on our way.
【Rika】
I see...
【Misaki】
Wh-Why won't you look us in the eyes? Whoaaa, now I really don't wanna see... Should we run home? Yeah, let's just go.
【Masaya】
Going home isn't an option. Come on, let's take a look.
【Misaki】
How can you be so calm, Masaya?
【Masaya】
Because I see no reason to fear whoever it is you're facing.
【Misaki】
Well <i>I'm</i> scared! I'm super scared of <i>whoever</i> it is I'm facing!
【Masaya】
Just get moving!
【Misaki】
W-Whoa! Hold it, buster! My heart's not ready!
I grab hold of Misaki's arm and drag her with me.
【Masaya】
Hm, Misaki Tobisawa, where are you...
【Misaki】
Don't look! Just stop! I can't take this! I wanna go home and get into bed and just hibernate!
【Masaya】
Hm, Misaki Tobisawa, Misaki Tobisawa...
【Misaki】
I told you not to look, dammit! I'm going home!
【Masaya】
You're not "going home"! God, just start looking for your name already.
【Misaki】
Nooo!
That was the wail of someone drowning in despair.
【Masaya】
Guess you found yourself.
【Misaki】
......
Misaki points at the sheet, remaining absolutely silent.
【Masaya】
Hm... Oh, cool.
【Misaki】
M-M-M-M-M-M-Masaya-san? May I inquire as to why you're so calm right now? Has the shock rattled you, perhaps?
【Masaya】
You're the one going crazy here, not me.
【Misaki】
Yes, I am! How can I have luck <i>this</i> bad?! This is ridiculous! I can't even!
The name next to Misaki is... Saki Inui.
【Masaya】
This is a good thing.
【Misaki】
How?!
【Masaya】
I was hoping you'd get to face her in the first round.
【Misaki】
Wow, you've finally decided to reveal your sadistic tendencies, huh?!
【Masaya】
Just calm down and listen to me. If you face Inui in the first round, she won't get a chance to see what you're capable of. Things are stacked overwhelmingly in your favor.
【Misaki】
...I guess you're right, but it also skyrockets the chance that I'll be knocked out in the first round.
【Masaya】
You'd have to face Inui at some point. Doesn't matter if it's the first round, the second, whenever. If you lose, you lose. May as well get it over with.
【Misaki】
......
【Masaya】
You'll have to face both Inui and Asuka at some point. Doing it in the first round while we still have some tricks up our sleeve is the best option.
【Misaki】
......
【Masaya】
This is our best shot of winning.
【Misaki】
I get what you're saying...
【Masaya】
If you do, then you just have to agree.
【Misaki】
Yeah, hm, haaah, hmmmmmm, yeah...
Misaki drops her raised shoulders.
【Misaki】
Haaaaaah...
Then, she breathes a shallow sigh.
Her complexion has changed ever so slightly.
【Misaki】
Come to think of it, that day we first practiced with Mr. Shitous...
【Masaya】
What about it?
【Misaki】
The two of us touched Inui-san's chest.
【Masaya】
Why the hell are you bringing that up now?!
How'd she end up remembering that of all things?
【Misaki】
You're the one who started it.
【Masaya】
You're being ridiculous!
【Misaki】
Haaaaaah, doesn't matter if I agree to it or not, my first match is with Inui-san.
【Masaya】
This stroke of luck has me convinced. Today's gonna be your day, Misaki.
【Misaki】
You mean I'm gonna win, huh?
【Masaya】
Of course.
I clap Misaki on the back.
【Rika】
...You're making a really scary face, Tobisawa-san. You look like a completely different person from earlier.
【Misaki】
Huh, I am? Really? Doesn't feel like it...
【Rika】
You're very scary today... Yes.
【Misaki】
Hahahaha, I-I'm not really sure how to respond.
【Rika】
The players from Kunahama Academy are incredible. First Asuka looked happy that she had to play against Inui, and now you look positively terrifying.
【Misaki】
Hm, but what's so incredible about that? Maybe Asuka is for being happy about it, but I think my scary face is pretty normal.
【Rika】
You think it's normal?
【Misaki】
It <i>is</i> normal.
【Rika】
It really isn't. We're talking about the player who defeated Shindou-senpai at the summer tournament, and then went and won the nationals. I could never face her.
【Misaki】
......
【Rika】
Can you win, Tobisawa-san?
【Misaki】
That's the plan. I'm pretty sure you'd feel the same in my shoes, Ichinose-chan.
【Rika】
We can't know that for sure... But I am rooting for you. Good luck out there.
【Misaki】
Thanks.
Ichinose bows, then walks away.
【Misaki】
Do you think Ichinose-chan's stagnated?
【Masaya】
Can't say.
Ichinose's a simple, straightforward girl, so it's just like her to try and tackle things head on.
Maybe I could give her some useful advice, but she hasn't asked for any, so it's not my place to get involved.
Though, what if I had gone to Takafuji? What if the two of us had worked together? Trying to help a player like her improve sounds fun.
【Masaya】
Right, let's look for the others.
【Misaki】
Um, Asuka's in a different block, I guess?
【Masaya】
Mashiro's in that one, too.
【Misaki】
Hm, so if I beat Inui-san, the only other real threat on this side is Ganeko.
That weird girl who's Arika's "big sister," huh?
I'm pretty sure she's a strong player in her own right. Suisan is known for having many skilled Skywalkers.
【Masaya】
That'll be a tough match... Oh! Mask is in the same block as you. You might even face each other in the second round.
【Misaki】
I'd rather die than face them! I'm pretty sure if they ordered me to lose, I'd just go and do it...
【Masaya】
Whether you win or lose is up to you, Misaki.
【Misaki】
Oh <i>paw-lease!</i> You're supposed to scold me when I'm saying something stupid!
【Masaya】
No point scolding someone who's already thrown in the towel.
【Misaki】
Okay, no more kitten around! I'm gonna beat Ganeko and Mask and go all the way to the finals!
【Misaki】
...You think I'll meet Asuka there?
【Masaya】
Probably.
【Misaki】
I wonder what I'll end up thinking if things do end up that way.
【Masaya】
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
【Misaki】
When we come to it? You really think I'll get there?
【Masaya】
You will. Today's your day, Misaki.
I stare straight into her eyes as I say that.
【Masaya】
Shirase-san's running a booth here like he did at the summer tournament. I'm sure Prez and Mask are already there.
【Shirase】
Well, isn't this a stroke of luck.
【Shion】
Your first match is against Inui! This is going even better than I hoped!
【Masked Skywalker】
You should rejoice that you aren't facing the mask. It would have been your one way ticket to hell!
【Misaki】
Oh, yes. I'll count my lucky stars.
【Shirase】
Now then, Misaki-chan. Whether you win or lose, just make sure you make it a real showy match to hype up the audience. I need every sales boost I can get.
【Misaki】
I-I'll do my best!
【Masaya】
You're not a professional, so you don't need to care about that.
"Winning or losing doesn't matter, just as long as the audience gets a good show" isn't something for amateurs to stress over.
【Misaki】
I know that, but I feel like I owe him for helping us out so much.
【Shirase】
I plan on turning you into our salesgirl when you win, Misaki-chan, with all the signage handcrafted by you and a life-sized cardboard cut out to go with it, so you better win.
【Misaki】
Is that really gonna happen?
【Masaya】
Sure sounds like it.
【Misaki】
No one told me any of that!
【Masaya】
Well, that aside...
【Misaki】
Not sure we should just brush it off like that, but... Well, whatever. You guys did help me out a bunch.
【Shion】
Good luck with the match, Tobisawa.
【Misaki】
Oh, thanks... I-I'll do my best!
Misaki squeezes out those words.
【Shion】
Good!
【Masked Skywalker】
Ensure you do your best!
【Misaki】
I will! You too, Mask!
【Masked Skywalker】
Mhm!
【Masaya】
Right, Misaki. As soon as the opening ceremony's over, we'll discuss your strategy.
【Masaya】
We've practiced this whole time assuming Inui will be your opponent, so it may not be that necessary, but I still want to go over things just in case.
【Misaki】
Okay... Aight, aight, aiiight!
Misaki shakes her head as if trying to brush something out of her mind, her long hair swaying from side to side.
【Misaki】
I can do this!
Misaki's voice is drowned out by the noise from the venue as speakers blare out warnings that the opening ceremony is about to begin.
【Misaki】
It's really starting.
【Masaya】
It sure is.
【Misaki】
Back when summer break first started, I thought I'd never come back here again.
【Masaya】
Yet here you are.
【Misaki】
Ah...
Misaki looks up at the sky in blank amazement.
【Masaya】
No matter how much I look at the sky, I never see any monsters or UFOs.
Then, she turns to face me.
【Misaki】
...I made it.
【Masaya】
Made it? Made what?
【Misaki】
Remember how you told me you'd "get me there"?
【Masaya】
Huh? But we won't know until after this.
【Misaki】
No. I've already made it here.
【Masaya】
...Huh?
【Misaki】
I never thought I'd get to face Inui-san or Asuka. I assumed I'd be curled up in a ball, crying.
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
The fear twisted my heart. I hoped that Satouin-san would beat Asuka. It would've made me happy, or so I thought.
【Masaya】
...Right.
【Misaki】
I like Asuka. She's a good girl. I was the twisted one. I was to blame, I was the useless one, but I wanted her to be just as bad as me.
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
I knew that made me a horrible person, but I couldn't help it... However, now I can stand and face Asuka with no thoughts weighing down on my mind. I just know it. I've made it. Does that make sense? Um...
Misaki thinks hard.
【Misaki】
Right now, I'm not afraid of being here. This is the place you helped me reach.
【Masaya】
...I see. So I was able to get you there.
【Misaki】
I'm not saying I have a pure heart. It's still, like, dirty, I guess? Yeah, it is. It is, but I can stand here without paying any attention to that stuff because I know that all of it makes me who I am.
【Masaya】
Looks like our summer break wasn't wasted.
【Misaki】
Nope! I've never had such a fulfilling summer before. Makes me wanna try my hand at writing poetry about it or something... Th-Thanks for getting me here, Masaya!
【Masaya】
You're very welcome. I'm happy for you.
【Misaki】
Hahahahaha. Right, so I... I did it. I'm actually here. I haven't felt like this in ages. Yes! I'm amazing!
Misaki spreads out her arms and spins like a little girl.
【Misaki】
Hahahahahahahaha... Ah!
Misaki suddenly snaps to a halt.
【Misaki】
I need to apologize for calling Asuka a monster.
【Masaya】
She doesn't even know you said that, so there's no need to apologize. Don't get yourself in trouble for nothing.
【Misaki】
Guess that's true.
Misaki smiles wryly.
I suddenly shiver.
【Masaya】
......
I can feel something clinging to my back.
"I can see you."
I call out to it in my mind.
"Hide all you want, I know you're there," I say to the dark amoeba like thing.
It's jealousy. No, not jealousy. That word doesn't cover everything about this feeling. It's actually something far worse.
"Get lost. Get out. Leave me be!"
I audibly sigh as I shake off those thoughts.
【Masaya】
Would've been better if you felt this way after the tournament.
【Misaki】
Why's that?
【Masaya】
Well, like... isn't your motivation gonna suffer now?
【Misaki】
Nope. I'm still afraid to lose, and still desperate to win.
【Masaya】
Why?
【Misaki】
Because now it's my turn to help you. And to do that, I've gotta win.
【Masaya】
You think I'll get there if you win?
【Misaki】
Yeah, 'course you will! When you see someone you've helped getting results, you'll know you did the right thing.
【Masaya】
True.
Will that <i>actually</i> work, though? I feel like a lot of people have already done that, but nothing's changed.
What is it I'm searching for?
【Misaki】
I'm gonna win this, for both my sake and yours.
【Masaya】
Okay, let's do this!
【Misaki】
Yeah!
Misaki pumps her hands into the air as she cries.
I'm walking alone, thinking about the match with Inui.
My mind is abuzz with thoughts like, "we're not missing anything, are we?" and "is this really the right strategy?" down to the wire.
【Irina】
Long time, no see, I think they say.
Perhaps this is just a coincidence...
But I suddenly find Irina-san by my side.
【Masaya】
Oh, hello.
【Irina】
You didn't stop being coach?
【Masaya】
I continued in secret.
【Irina】
Too bad you not there during match between Kurashina-san and Saki. I wanted your impression...
【Masaya】
You'll get to see them through Misaki in today's match.
【Irina】
The player who not make much impact during summer tournament? That very interesting. Is interesting right word?
【Masaya】
It is. This match should be <i>very</i> interesting.
【Irina】
You get my hopes up, but I am sure to be disappointed.
【Masaya】
We won't embarrass ourselves. Asuka will be watching this match, and I promised her I'd make Misaki stronger.
【Irina】
So you made promise with Kurashina-san?
【Irina】
Tobisawa-san never produced impressive results. Would it not be difficult to fulfill promise with such mediocre player?
【Masaya】
You won't be disappointed.
【Irina】
So you say, but Saki is best at defeating Fighters. I am assured I will be met with the disappointment.
【Masaya】
Oh yeah? Unfortunately I'm not too concerned with how you feel, Irina-san.
For a moment she seems offended, but she soon breaks out into a smile.
【Irina】
I look forward to it.
With that, she leaves.
Oh...
I can feel something opening inside my heart.
Back when I decided to coach Misaki, I felt steel and wind inside my heart.
But right now...
It's something far more grotesque, something that's been spiraling inside me for a while now. It reminds me of back when I was still playing FC.
The top of the world.... And by world, I mean like, world-class level. It's a place where only people who want to win exist.
Misaki just said...
That she's afraid to lose.
The top of the world is a place where everyone is afraid to lose. A place where people fear losing because they're under the impression that if they do, they'll no longer belong.
How did I feel back then?
There should've been tons of fun memories. No, I know the fun times outweighed everything else. Yet, for some reason, all I can remember are the negatives.
There were lots of Skywalkers who engaged in mind games before the start of a match.
Compared to that, what Irina-san just said was kind.
My mind is calm. My heart sober. My eyes open.
If she thought that would be enough to unsettle me, she's way off the mark.
Wait!
【Masaya】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah...
Calm down!
I'm overthinking this, which is exactly what Irina-san wants me to do.
It's okay, everything's fine. You realized what was going on. You're back on track. You're calm.
I take a deep breath as I look up at the sky.
We'll prove that Misaki's got what it takes to win this whole thing. There's no need to think about anything else.
I'm convinced.
【Misaki】
Let's have a good match.
【Saki】
...Let's.
After the two players exchange their pre-match pleasantries, I speak to Misaki over my headset, trying to keep my tone light.
【Masaya】
How're you feeling?
【Misaki】
Not too bad.
She forces herself to sound relaxed.
【Masaya】
Not everything is decided the moment the match begins, so you don't need to be tense. Hell, you'll forget all about your tension when it starts anyway.
【Misaki】
Right.
【Masaya】
Just do what we've planned. I know you'll win.
【Misaki】
Sure thing.
【Masaya】
How's Inui feeling?
Misaki lowers her voice.
【Misaki】
She's just been staring at second this whole time.
【Masaya】
What about her mouth?
【Misaki】
Not moving.
【Masaya】
Got it.
I hinted at just how strong Misaki was in my conversation with Irina-san. I thought that may have raised their guard a little.
But if they were being extra vigilant, they would be talking to the very last second.
Irina-san played me like a damn fiddle during our conversation.
The ref tells the players to get ready, and a short while later, the blaring horn signals the start of the match.
【Saki】
......
Inui immediately heads into a perfect Low Yo-Yo, rocketing toward second.
【Misaki】
......
Misaki jumps to the second line in response.
Inui's <i>really</i> fast.
She's still on the first line, so she hasn't even reached max speed yet, but she's still extremely quick.
This match will be decided by how Inui decides to move on the second line.
Misaki is circling slightly above the line as she waits.
This height should make her opponent think she's not considering her positioning.
However, if Inui moves to steal her position, Misaki will just barely take the height advantage first.
What'll happen?
Inui touches second.
0:1.
【Masaya】
......
I gulp as I watch and wait. Time moves slowly, each fraction of a second feels like an eternity.
【Misaki】
......
Misaki probably feels the same way.
Inui uses the recoil from the buoy to accelerate. She shoots off straight along the line.
【Masaya】
Ah...!
My heart starts racing.
Yes!
Inui and Irina-san clearly don't know anything about Misaki!
I was worried that they may have caught wind of our practice sessions at the beach.
But it seems like Misaki's lack of results in any previous tournaments kept them from looking into her.
【Masaya】
Misaki! Press down on Inui's head!
【Misaki】
Got it!
【Saki】
......
Inui's definitely fast. However, we've been practicing this exact same move on Prez, the fastest Speeder I know, who can now employ feints.
【Misaki】
Eat this!
【Saki】
Huh...?!
Surprise instantly runs through Inui.
Bet she never expected that.
Shirase-san let me watch some of her matches at from the nationals when I was at his store.
Inui played all her matches as a Speeder, racking up points through buoys alone to completely dominate her opponent.
The tactic that shocked us to our cores was one she only used against Shindou-san.
The level of FC on Shitou is higher than it is at the nationals.
I doubt Inui has any tactics she uses against strong players other than maintaining a height advantage.
And she doesn't see Misaki as a strong player.
Inui is sent downward from the impact. Meanwhile, Misaki, who used both hands to press down on Inui, swings her arms to take advantage of the recoil and pulls upward.
She's kept the height advantage.
This is exactly how Inui acted in the summer tournament, as well as in her match against Asuka at the Takafuji training camp.
And now Misaki can do it too!
I want to scream my thoughts from the top of my lungs.
What'll you do now, Inui?! What about you, Irina?!
You don't wanna reveal the ace up your sleeve, right?
You don't wanna show your method for attacking from a lower position, do you? That's your trump card. Of course you want to keep it hidden.
I bet you were hoping to conceal it until you got to Asuka in the finals. I'm right, aren't I?
You've already got a one point lead. What'll you do now?
You revealed it in your practice match against Asuka, right? Are you gonna do it now?
Inui looks up at Misaki as she changes her trajectory.
I knew it.
She jumps to the third line.
【Masaya】
Misaki, you know what to do.
【Misaki】
I know.
Misaki pulls into a Low Yo-Yo to accelerate and touch third.
Now it's 1:1.
【Masaya】
Misaki, don't lose focus! We can't afford a single mistake in a match like this!
【Misaki】
Roger!
If we leave a gap that lets Inui score a point in a dogfight, or let her touch two buoys in a row, we're done.
The score is currently 1:1.
1:2.
2:2.
2:3.
3:3.
3:4. This is going exactly the way I hoped.
They now know that Misaki's learned to keep a height advantage, but we're still hiding that we've figured out a way to attack from below.
If this keeps up, we'll head into overtime based on the scores being even, then eventually sudden death. In that case, whoever scores first will win.
As long as we keep the score the same or within a one point margin, we can pull out a win. There's no need to reveal our trump card.
Sure, Irina-san purposefully brought up Asuka's name in conversation, but I was doing some preparations of my own.
Now I just hope her plan is to not reveal anything they want to keep secret until their match with Asuka.
Inui waits above the third line.
Seeing this, Misaki jumps to the fourth line.
Yes!
Everything's still going as planned.
【Mashiro】
Go. Misaki-senpai! You can do it! I know you can!
【Madoka】
You can do it...! Hey, Asuka-chan.
【Asuka】
......
【Madoka】
Asuka-chan!
【Asuka】
Oh, y-yes, what is it?
【Madoka】
You're concentrating <i>super</i> hard, huh?
【Asuka】
I'm so happy that Misaki-chan's learned the meaning of keeping a height advantage! She really is incredible!
【Mashiro】
Of course she is! Misaki-senpai can do anything!
【Asuka】
Yes... But I'm worried this might be too much for her.
【Mashiro】
She does seem tired, yeah... But that's not a problem. Misaki-senpai is incredible even when she's tired!
【Madoka】
You know, this is going pretty much the same as your match with Inui-san, Asuka-chan.
【Mashiro】
Come to think of it... they are just jumping lines and letting each other to touch buoys one at a time. They're trading points without Misaki-senpai ever getting in front, just like in your match.
【Madoka】
At this rate, Misaki's gonna lose, isn't she? Did you teach Hinata-kun how to counter Inui-san, Ms. Kagami?
【Aoi】
Hm? I didn't teach him anything.
【Madoka】
Why not?
【Aoi】
Because thinking through these things is what helps you grow. Masaya had to do it by himself, so I let him.
【Mashiro】
Then, if Masaya-senpai hasn't figured anything out--
【Asuka】
Misaki-chan will win!
【Aoi】
Why do you think that?
【Asuka】
Because there's no way they haven't thought up anything with the two of them working together.
【Aoi】
It's not easy to think of a tactic to break through this deadlock.
【Asuka】
That doesn't matter. The two of them are geniuses!
【Aoi】
The two of them, huh?
【Asuka】
Yes!
【Aoi】
...I think so too. But what exactly is a genius to you, Kurashina?
【Asuka】
Well... Um, hm... Someone who can not only meet your expectations, but exceed them.
【Aoi】
Indeed. A genius is someone who exceeds your expectations, I'm sure.
【Asuka】
Yes! I know it!
【Shirase】
Now the real match begins.
【Minamo】
Misaki-san is... incredibly tired... That looks hard...
【Shion】
She's pushing herself to the limit. I wonder if Hinata's instructions are too much for her...
【Minamo】
They simply... can't be...
【Shion】
Yeah, there's no way.
【Shirase】
I <i>am</i> worried. Being tired slows your decision making.
【Shion】
But if things go according to plan... and if Tobisawa can pull off her SuMo without panicking, she'll win, right?
【Shirase】
But the chances of pulling off an attack from below, even for Misaki-chan, aren't high.
【Shion】
On the other hand, Inui will be seeing it for the first time, so her reactions will be delayed.
【Shirase】
Inui's something special, though.
【Minamo】
She will... do it... I'm... absolutely... certain...
【Shirase】
Oh? Why's that?
【Minamo】
I can just... tell. I can feel it... in the air... This is how... it feels when Tobisawa-san is concentrating... extremely hard...
【Shion】
Well, if that's what you think, you must be right, Minamo-chan.
【Shirase】
...The problem now then is when Masaya makes the call.
【Shion】
It doesn't matter how hard Tobisawa is concentrating if Hinata messes up the timing...
【Minamo】
Masaya-san won't fail... Those two are... completely in... sync... They're getting closer... all the time... So he won't fail... Though it hurts to admit...
【Shirase】
......
【Shirase】
I see... So it hurts?
【Minamo】
Yes... It hurts.
【Shirase】
...Right.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah...
Misaki's gasping for air.
This isn't a particularly intense match. If anything, it's the opposite. The kind that might be met with boos from a crowd who don't understand what's going on.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah...
I wonder how many people in the audience realize how hard Misaki's working to remain vigilant?
Things have continued in the exact same way they began. There are two minutes left, and they're dead even at 6:6. Inui's hovering above the fourth line, while Misaki is approaching first.
【Masaya】
Misaki... We're using the SuMo next.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah... Why the hell'd we settle on calling it SuMo? It totally kills the hype.
【Masaya】
You're the one who said you were fine with the name.
【Misaki】
I didn't actually mean it, though...
【Masaya】
Could you pant a bit harder? Don't make it seem unnatural, though.
【Misaki】
Why?
【Masaya】
We're going to make them think you've been cornered and are lashing out.
【Misaki】
Wow, that's a pretty low blow, Coach.
【Masaya】
This is all part of FC. Just think of it like a feint. You need to do all you can to try and deceive your opponent if you want to win. And you don't want to lose, do you?
【Misaki】
I don't want to lose.
【Masaya】
What was that?
【Misaki】
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE!
【Masaya】
Then get going!
【Misaki】
Ah...!
Misaki charges, shoulders heaving, teeth clenched, and an expression of sheer frustration on her face.
I don't look over at Irina-san, but I'm sure there's a scornful smile on her face.
I hope that smile only breaks the moment she realizes she's been completely outdone.
【Misaki】
Meooooooooooooooow!
【Saki】
......
Inui positions herself to intercept.
Misaki's charging, her back exposed, seemingly completely exhausted.
The natural response is to intercept. Even if Inui's managed to notice something, and has her guard up...
Has Irina-san? Has she realized? Is she afraid of Misaki? Is she telling Inui to be careful?
Misaki heads straight for Inui while maintaining normal flight.
Inui hovers slightly higher up.
She plans to drag Misaki in, then create enough space for her to touch Misaki's back. She's rising now to create that personal space for herself. Doing so will make it easier to think calmly.
When's the right moment?! When should I make the call?!
【Masaya】
Misaki!
【Misaki】
Got it!
Misaki does a half-roll into inverted flight.
【Saki】
Huh...?!
The two end up flying parallel, facing each other. Inui on top, Misaki down below.
Inui attempts to tear away from Misaki, displeased by the recent development.
【Saki】
Ah...!
【Misaki】
I won't let you get away.
Inui reaches her hands out behind her in the direction she's moving, interrupting her flight.
She avoids Misaki's hands in disgust. Her speed is dropping now. Perfect.
Go, Misaki! GO!
You've slowed down, and you're right in each other's faces now!
Misaki succeeded in exchanging blows with Shindou-san at the Takafuji training camp before the summer tournament. This is <i>her</i> domain.
【Misaki】
I've got you now!
【Saki】
Ngh?!
Misaki rocks herself in a semi-circle, moving left and right.
She's repeatedly feinting which side she plans on pulling up above from.
【Saki】
Ah...!
Inui is increasingly frustrated, bending further forward in an attempt to pull away from Misaki. But now she's unable to make any subtle movements.
Misaki draws a small circle as she turns sideways into an ascent.
【Masaya】
Whoa...!
【Saki】
Ah...!
She's got the height advantage at point blank range, which means Inui's back is right within her reach.
【Misaki】
Got you!
Misaki reaches out a hand...
【Saki】
Ngh!
7:6.
The recoil sends them flying in opposite directions.
【Misaki】
I did it!
【Saki】
Ah...!
【Misaki】
Huh?
Determination solidifies in Inui's eyes as she shoots up like a bullet.
She's wearing Speeder shoes, which means her initial velocity should be low. How'd she manage to gain so much speed that quickly?
Wait, no!
【Masaya】
Misaki, this isn't the time to relax!
【Misaki】
Y-Yeah! Aaah!
Inui rushes up to Misaki.
She managed to reclaim the height advantage that quickly? I know Misaki lowered her guard after scoring a point, but...
No, that doesn't matter right now!
【Masaya】
Misaki! Don't lose!
Misaki immediately resumes her inverted flight.
【Misaki/Saki】
I won't lose!
【Misaki】
I won't lose!
【Saki】
I won't lose!
【Misaki】
I won't, I won't, I won't lose!
Inui plunges down toward Misaki, who's flying inverted. Misaki simply does a half-rotation to the side and ascends.
Their positions have swapped again.
Inui opens her mouth wide and screams.
【Saki】
I won't lose!
They're like two sides of the same coin.
If Misaki had let her concentration slip for just a second longer, or if there'd been a slightly bigger gap in her inverted flight...
Then I'm certain that she would've been overwhelmed by Inui, and had the tables turned on her again.
But...
Misaki's grown stronger.
Now that she's taken the lead, she'll defend it to the bitter end.
The match ends.
The two players come to a halt.
Inui's shoulders heave as she stares fixedly at Misaki.
【Saki】
......
【Misaki】
Huh?
Inui approaches.
I can hear her voice through Misaki's microphone.
【Saki】
If you could do that, you should have done it sooner.
【Misaki】
...Huh?
【Saki】
I've always wanted... to spend a whole match... fighting over positions. Why didn't you... do that from the start?
There's anger in her voice.
【Saki】
I just wanted to... fight over our positions.
【Misaki】
...Well, 'cause I was scared of you, Inui-san.
【Saki】
I was scary...
Misaki nods.
【Misaki】
I was scared, and I really wanted to win no matter what. If I'd lost, it would've felt like I'd lost everything.
【Saki】
I lost... something...?
【Misaki】
I'm not you, so I don't know, but... I'm still scared of you, even now.
【Saki】
......
【Misaki】
So I'm going to keep on thinking up new ways to beat you. That way, I'll win the next time we meet. I'm <i>super</i> terrified of actually fighting you for positioning, after all.
【Saki】
...I see.
【Saki】
...In the end, I was all alone.
【Misaki】
Huh...?
【Saki】
No, it's nothing...
Inui shakes her head.
【Saki】
Next time... I hope you'll follow along with my game.
【Misaki】
D-Don't mind if I do.
【Saki】
...Good.
Inui smiles, then leaves Misaki.
【Irina】
We fell for your trap.
【Masaya】
You can leave the resentment aside. You basically did the same thing to Shindou-san at the summer tournament.
I don't think they did anything wrong in their match against Shindou-san. Well, I might have at the time, but not now.
【Irina】
This match has me convinced.
【Masaya】
Of what?
【Irina】
That you can master "true FC," Masaya Hinata.
【Masaya】
What is "true FC," exactly?
【Irina】
Don't act like you don't know.
【Masaya】
......
【Irina】
Facing Tobisawa-san is all well and good, but I would prefer it if you were Saki's opponent next time, Hinata-san.
Irina-san leaves behind those parting words and walks away.
Act like I don't know, huh?
For some reason, I feel the strength drain from me. Whether I know or not, I have no intention of telling Irina-san.
【Misaki】
Wow, I actually managed to win!
【Masaya】
Good job. You were amazing!
【Misaki】
Dude, like, dude, Inui-san was <i>so</i> scary! Like, totally overwhelming! It's hard to believe she's even human.
【Masaya】
That makes the fact that you said, "don't mind if I do" when she challenged you to a fair fight all the more impressive.
【Misaki】
Oh, you heard that? It's sort of a bad habit I picked up from talking to Mask.
【Masaya】
So, what'll you do? Actually try and take her on head first?
【Misaki】
Head first...? Nope, not happening.
Misaki's face is dead serious.
【Misaki】
We'll have to cook up something new when the time comes.
【Masaya】
Sounds good to me.
I smile and nod.
The back of my neck tingles.
【Masaya】
Ngh!
【Misaki】
Hm? Something wrong?
【Masaya】
Nothing.
I scratch the back of my head.
【Masaya】
My head just itches a little.
【Misaki】
Hm...
That ticklish feeling begins to spread down my entire back.
Misaki beat Inui.
Goosebumps suddenly ripple down the back of my neck.
That dark amoeba is beginning to creep around my side.
【Mashiro】
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow! I've never been this moved in my life!
【Asuka】
I'm so moved too! That was incredible! Incredibly incredible!
【Mashiro】
That's my Misaki-senpai!
【Madoka】
So as far as you're concerned, Mashirocchi, she already belongs to you, huh?
【Asuka】
Let's go see Misaki-chan!
【Madoka】
I know Hinata-kun's splitting up our waiting areas to keep his secrets, but going to congratulate her should be fine, yeah?
【Mashiro】
Yeah! Totally! I won't stand for his tyrannical oppression. No one can keep Misaki-senpai and I apart!
【Satouin】
Cease this foolishness at once.
【Asuka】
Oh, you're here, Satouin-san.
【Satouin】
I just arrived. I <i>am</i> your second, so of course we need to meet and discuss.
【Mashiro】
Why can't we go see Misaki-senpai?
【Satouin】
If you think about how Masaya Hinata feels, I'm sure you'll understand.
【Madoka】
What do you mean?
【Satouin】
He plans on taking Misaki Tobisawa to the finals, where he'll make her face Asuka Kurashina. For that reason, he doesn't want the two of them to see each other right now.
【Mashiro】
But why not?
【Satouin】
Because it is hard to hit a friend.
【Madoka】
But this is a match, not a fight.
【Satouin】
It's the same principle... No, it is different. What's the best way to phrase this?
【Asuka】
......
【Satouin】
A fight is impure. It exists to let out your emotions.
【Madoka】
Impure?
【Satouin】
Violence is, abuse is, even ignoring someone is. But a match is pure. It's a restricted competition of strength. And because it's pure, the more serious you are about it, the bigger the wounds are if you lose.
【Mashiro】
It's pure so it... hurts more?
【Satouin】
Consider my duel with Asuka Kurashina. We were able to become friends after the fact, but that does not change the wounds left on my heart.
【Asuka】
I-I never meant to hurt you, Satouin-san!
【Satouin】
Your intentions do not change the pain in the least.
【Satouin】
If I were to defeat you now, like Misaki Tobisawa just did in her match, while you're trying to prove how incredible Saki Inui is... how would you feel?
【Asuka】
...It would hurt. I'd feel like she was denying everything I've worked for.
【Satouin】
I'm certain you and Misaki Tobisawa will manage to remain friends no matter the outcome. But if you were to meet each other now, you may not be able to give your all in the upcoming match, and that is a source of worry.
【Asuka】
Is that so...?
【Satouin】
You may not think that way, but Misaki Tobisawa might. In fact, neither of you may think that way. However, it's still better that you don't meet beforehand, don't you agree?
【Asuka】
I...
【Asuka】
I've probably been naive about a lot of things.
【Asuka】
About fighting, and winning... and even losing.
【Satouin】
...Not at all. I'm fully aware of how strict you are on yourself.
【Asuka】
......
【Satouin】
If you weren't, you'd never have been able to endure Ms. Kagami's strict coaching.
【Asuka】
Oh no, it wasn't that bad... I don't get it! I don't even know how to say it! Lately, I... I've had trouble figuring out how to treat Misaki-chan.
【Mashiro】
Asuka-senpai...?
【Asuka】
I know I shouldn't feel like this. I know it's wrong...
【Asuka】
You know what you were saying, Satouin-san? About pure and impure? Well I'm... impure.
【Madoka】
......
【Asuka】
I like Misaki-chan, but there was this thought that crossed my mind...
【Asuka】
I hoped, for a second, that she'd lose to Inui-san. I didn't want to...! But it's because I'm not strong like you that I had that thought.
【Satouin】
You're wrong. Everyone knows there isn't a person on Earth who's devoid of dark feelings. Even I have a fair number of my own. So...
【Asuka】
So?
【Satouin】
Let out all your feelings during the match. The conversations, congratulations, and jealousy can begin after that.
【Asuka】
Okay!
【Shirase】
Congrats!
【Shion】
You did it!
【Misaki】
Congratulations!
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahahahahaha! An overwhelming victory!
【Everyone】
Ah...!
【Masaya】
Ah...!
【Misaki】
Ah...!
【Shirase】
Ah...!
【Shion】
Ah...!
Things suddenly gets awkward.
I'm pretty sure we all realized this a while ago... but I guess the person in question didn't notice.
Masked Skywalker hurriedly flips the switch on their voice modulator.
【Masked Skywalker】
Th-That was nothing.
【Shion】
Nothing at all.
Prez gives a huge nod.
I continue to act like nothing's happened.
【Masaya】
You pulled off your moves perfectly, Mask, so being your second was a lot of fun. I feel <i>really</i> satisfied right now.
【Masked Skywalker】
Hahahahahahaha!
They pulled off an easy win against the Dougaura player. The final score was 5:0.
Shirase-san covers his eyes with his hands.
【Shirase】
I'm so glad I let you be Misaki-chan's training partner.
【Masked Skywalker】
D-Don't cry, Big Brother!
【Everyone】
Ah...!
【Masaya】
Ah...!
【Misaki】
Ah...!
【Shirase】
Ah...!
【Shion】
Ah...!
Things get awkward yet again.
【Masked Skywalker】
Y-You heard wrong... I didn't say "big brother"!
Man...
【Everyone】
......
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
......
【Shirase】
......
【Shion】
......
All of us do everything in our power to look off in different directions and pretend we weren't listening.
【Shion】
Oh, come to think of it...
Prez acts casually as he speaks up.
【Shion】
Turns out it's fine to have a student from a different FC club act as your second, huh?
【Masaya】
I heard Asuka and Mashiro have Satouin-san as their second.
【Shion】
Oh, really?
【Misaki】
I'm no better, but Asuka and Mashiro <i>definitely</i> aren't suited for being seconds, so it makes sense... But what about Satouin-san's match?
【Masaya】
Apparently she's not participating this time.
【Misaki】
Whaaat?!
【Masaya】
Seems she and Asuka got really close over the summer break.
【Misaki】
Asuka really is incredible. She might not know it, but she has this way of attracting people.
【Masaya】
Guess so.
【Misaki】
Well, anyway, the next match is between me and Mask... What're we doing about seconds?
【Shion】
I'll be Mask's second.
【Masked Skywalker】
Rejected!
【Shion】
My poor heart!
【Shirase】
You can't reject him now, can you?
【Masked Skywalker】
But...
【Masaya】
I'm going to be Misaki's second, but I don't plan on giving her any instructions.
【Misaki】
Huh?
【Masaya】
Same goes for Prez.
【Shion】
Exactly. We won't speak up unless one of you loses sight of your opponent. You'll fight this match on your own strengths.
【Misaki】
I get it now.
【Masked Skywalker】
Then we can just as easily do the reverse!
【Masaya】
Think about it logically, okay? It has to be this way.
【Masked Skywalker】
When I win this match, I'll have you switch seconds with me for the rest of eternity!
【Misaki】
D-Don't mind if you do.
【Masaya】
No, you really should mind.
I turn to face Mask.
【Masaya】
I have to be Misaki's second, so can you please not complicate things?
【Masked Skywalker】
Grrrrrr!
【Misaki】
Oh! Is it okay for me to be this close to my opponent? Maybe we should step away from each other?
【Shirase】
You don't need to worry about that.
【Misaki】
You sure about that? Isn't this gonna make the match harder for us?
【Shirase】
What do you think, Misaki-chan?
【Misaki】
I don't really mind...
【Masked Skywalker】
I don't mind either.
【Shirase】
There you have it. The difference in skill between you two is pretty obvious. You still have a lot to learn before you can make Misaki-chan give it all she's got in a match, Mask.
【Masked Skywalker】
Th-That's not true!
【Shirase】
If you could, you wouldn't be around her right now.
【Masked Skywalker】
Ugh...
【Shirase】
I'm not criticizing you. This is a fine place for you to be right now. Just watch how a strong Skywalker and second do things. That's your job.
【Masked Skywalker】
It is?
【Shirase】
Yes. You're the only FC player Kamidorisha's got. Just observe how things go, and think about what it means to form a FC club.
【Masked Skywalker】
...Okay.
Mask turns to face Misaki with a snap.
【Masked Skywalker】
However, I have no intention of losing! To the gallows with you!
【Misaki】
D-Don't mind if I do.
【Misaki】
Oh, nice... Got you!
【Masked Skywalker】
Dammit!
Misaki's keeping a firm hold on the height advantage while she racks up the points.
We're only halfway through the match, but the score is already 10:0.
Part of me thinks this is overkill...
But I can't tell her to go easy on them. That would just hurt Mask more.
【Masked Skywalker】
Ugh! Ngh! Above!
When there's such an evident difference in skill, and the more skilled person holds back, the less skilled person often thinks they're being toyed with. It's humiliating, and difficult to recover from.
【Masked Skywalker】
Whoaaaaaaaaaaaa!
It's better to just lose badly. At least then you know you did everything you could.
【Misaki】
...I'm not gonna let you get above me.
What Misaki's doing may seem cruel, but it's the right thing to do.
【Masked Skywalker】
Ugh... Aww... Whoa... Hic... Ugh...
Their voice modulator's off, but nobody's about to point that out.
The match ends with a final score of 19:0.
【Masked Skywalker】
Hic... Hic... Aww, aaah... Ngh!
I can't see their face, but Mask's sobbing is clear as day.
【Shirase】
That was a good lesson.
【Shion】
If it hurts so bad you're crying, that means there's still a lot of room for you to grow, Minamo-chan.
【Masked Skywalker】
I'm not Minamo!
Prez's careless words elicit an angry response from Mask.
【Shirase】
You've gotten a lot stronger.
【Masked Skywalker】
I scored <i>zero</i> points!
【Shirase】
Misaki-chan's just too strong. She's one of the best players on Shitou.
【Masaya】
Understanding the importance of positioning is a strength. The only people at this tournament who can say they truly do are Misaki, Inui, Asuka, and you, Mask.
【Shirase】
Exactly. You would've made it much further if you didn't end up facing Misaki-chan so soon.
【Masked Skywalker】
......
【Misaki】
H-Hey, Mask. Thank you so much for everything! I look forward to working together in the future!
【Masked Skywalker】
I'll have you know I'm simply using you! Prepare yourself, for I shall make you a steppingstone on my path to greatness!
【Misaki】
O-Oh yes, don't mind if I do.
【Masked Skywalker】
You defeated me, so...! Ughhhhhhhhh... Make sure you win the finals!
【Misaki】
Y-Yes, don't mind if I-- I mean, I will!
Inui lost in the first round. Mask lost in the second round.
Ichinose in the third, and Mashiro in the third as well.
This is a tournament. The number of competitors decreases fast the further along you go.
The semifinals see Misaki facing Mayu Ganeko.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah... Take this!
【Mayu】
Ngh! Ughhh!
Misaki and Ganeko-san are spiraling around each other, ascending in a tangled helix when the horn blares to signal the end of the match.
5:3.
Misaki wobbles her way down to me after claiming victory.
【Masaya】
Good job.
【Misaki】
Ughhh, I'm beat!
【Masaya】
How was it?
【Misaki】
She was strong, but, well... she wasn't scary. Just plain strong.
【Masaya】
So you weren't afraid, huh?
【Misaki】
She just wasn't as scary as Inui-san. She threw a lot at me, but I never once thought I was gonna lose.
【Masaya】
Yeah, because your opponent doesn't know the importance of positioning.
【Misaki】
Yep! Feels like Inui-san's lesson on the importance of positioning finally came together. As long as I can keep the height advantage, I've got nothing to fear from down below.
【Masaya】
You're not gonna be saying that after your next match.
【Misaki】
...True.
Block B has already finished their matches. Asuka came out on top.
The finals of the fall tournament will be Misaki versus Asuka. A Kunahama showdown.
Suddenly...
I have a thought.
I want to see Aoi-san.
I want to talk to her. I want to discuss both Misaki and Asuka...
I want to talk about what's happened so far, and how the future will unfold.
I'd ask her if I did the right thing, if I got the right results.
What am I doing, trying to rely on Aoi-san at a time like this...?
【Masaya】
I'm too soft.
Misaki hasn't let herself see Mashiro, so I shouldn't let myself see Aoi-san either.
Softness begets defeat.
There'll be a ten minute break before the third place match. The finals will come after that.
Misaki's gone to the bathroom. Shirase-san and Minamo-chan are at the booth, waiting for the rush of customers they expect during the break.
Prez squints as he looks up at the sky.
【Shion】
Two of our students are facing off for the title... It feels unreal.
【Masaya】
Yeah. I never thought it'd end up like this.
I didn't even think I'd be involved with FC at the start of the year.
But here I am, right in the thick of it.
【Shion】
I wish I could cheer for Tobisawa, but I can't. Not that I can cheer for Kurashina either.
【Masaya】
Can't you just root for both of them?
【Shion】
No can do. I know how it feels to lose.
【Masaya】
......
【Shion】
If you root for both parties during a match, and clap every time a point is scored, you end up rooting for the winner more in the end, right? I'd hate that.
【Masaya】
You're really kind, Prez.
【Shion】
Don't be gross.
【Masaya】
Sorry.
【Shion】
The match hasn't started yet, so let me say this... Win this thing, Hinata.
【Masaya】
We will.
Winning...
I want to win.
But isn't this the feeling that's been tormenting me all these years?
Back on that summer day...
Back when I first met Misaki...
I ran away from winning and losing.
And yet...
【Masaya】
We <i>will</i> win.
I want Misaki to win. I know I do. The feeling is solid and unmoving inside me, like it's made of iron.
But... what is winning? Why do I even want her to do that?
I no longer know. The more I think about it, the more distant the answer feels.
I...
I feel something cold spreading through my body.
That dark amoeba covers the tips of my toes to the top of my head.
Where will I go after this?
【Misaki】
Is something wrong, Masaya?
Misaki looks up at me anxiously, having returned from the bathroom without me realizing.
【Masaya】
Oh, it's nothing. Just swearing to Prez that you'll come back a champion.
【Misaki】
My final match is against Asuka... I've been waiting for this day, but it's weird how it doesn't feel real.
【Masaya】
Yeah, it doesn't.
【Misaki】
Hm?
【Minamo】
Um...! Please... drink this..! It will... restore your stamina...! It's a top selling drink that... works quickly and has excellent results...!
【Misaki】
Y-You brought me a drink?
Misaki's face cramps up. This is clearly reminding her of the protein drink that "smelled like wet dog."
【Minamo】
This is delicious... It tastes like honey. Last time... I was just... trying to harass you a little... But I'm not doing that now...!
【Misaki】
Wait, you did that on purpose?!
Minamo-chan shuffles over to Misaki and starts mumbling something to her.
【Minamo】
(I liked... Masaya-san, so... I'm sorry...)
What'd she just say?
【Misaki】
Oh, well in that case, I can't really blame you. I'll drink that even if it tastes like wet cat!
【Minamo】
Ah...
Misaki snatches the bottle and downs it in one go.
【Misaki】
Mgh, mgh, mgh, mgh, pwaaaaaaaaah! Delicious! My stamina's completely restored!
【Minamo】
Hahahaha...! Please win... the tournament...!
【Misaki】
Okay!
Misaki gives her a big nod. Minamo-chan bows in response, then leaves.
【Masaya】
So, I'm about to ask something weird...
【Misaki】
Hm?
【Masaya】
What's winning to you?
【Misaki】
Where's this coming from?
【Masaya】
Just wondering if you expect to get something out of winning.
【Misaki】
You're really asking me that after you drag me all this way?
【Masaya】
Look, I know what you mean, but I'm curious.
【Misaki】
You wanna know what I expect? I think I kinda figured that out during this tournament.
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
It's not that I care about winning. Honestly, I kinda don't. It's the feeling of wanting to win that's important to me, I think.
【Masaya】
The feeling of wanting to win?
【Misaki】
Yeah. Wanting to win is like, wanting to give something your all, wanting to take it seriously, wanting to be here, and not wanting to lose.
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
Look, this isn't an excuse in case we lose, okay? Beating Asuka is the number one thing on my mind right now.
【Masaya】
I didn't doubt that for a second.
【Misaki】
There's still one corner of my mind that's hoping a giant monster will appear.
【Masaya】
You're still scared?
【Misaki】
I am. Not of Asuka, but of losing. Though, that said... if I can preserve the feeling of wanting to win, I think it's a victory even if I lose.
【Masaya】
A loss is still a loss, no matter how you put it.
【Misaki】
Yeah, but like, as long as I still want to win, I can keep playing FC. If I win, but lose that feeling, then I've actually lost.
【Masaya】
I guess. I kinda get what you're saying, but I also don't.
【Misaki】
What do you mean?
【Masaya】
If you lose, and I mean actually lose, will a simple feeling like that actually let you claim victory?
【Misaki】
If I really lose, I'll lose the feeling of wanting to win, too. I'm not just playing with words here... I'm being serious.
【Masaya】
I know. I understand what you're trying to say. And honestly, I think you're right.
【Misaki】
Cool! Glad you understand. Now, time to talk tactics. Just so you know, losing without giving it my all is what I hate most.
【Masaya】
What would you like most, then?
【Misaki】
...Hm, an overwhelmingly easy victory?
I smile wryly.
【Masaya】
That's not happening with Asuka as your opponent.
【Misaki】
Nope. Okay, hit me with everything you've got.
【Masaya】
Asuka isn't the type of player who aims for perfection. She prefers a challenge, so we'll use that against her.
【Masaya】
Let's have a good match.
【Satouin】
I truly didn't believe this would happen with Saki Inui standing in the way.
【Masaya】
We somehow pulled off a win.
Satouin-san shrugs her shoulders.
【Satouin】
Somehow, you say? You didn't let Misaki Tobisawa see Asuka Kurashina at all before any of the matches. Does that not mean you planned on winning from the start?
【Masaya】
If you're in this tournament, you need to plan on winning no matter your opponent.
【Satouin】
I believe Asuka Kurashina to be even stronger than Saki Inui. Let us ensure neither party has any regrets once this match ends.
【Masaya】
Of course.
With the formalities over, Satouin-san and I part.
She wants to make sure no one has any regrets, huh?
Sounds perfect.
But...
Given that someone has to win... and someone has to lose, is there <i>really</i> a situation where no one's left upset?
What am I thinking? We've made it all the way to the finals, so why am I acting like this?
Misaki's grown more and more pure with every passing match, but I feel like watching her has made me dirtier.
What am I thinking?
I can see Misaki and Asuka flying toward first.
I clap my hands lightly against my cheeks, trying to suppress the emotions whirling within me.
Let's win this, Misaki!
【Misaki】
Hey there, Asuka. You doing well?
【Asuka】
Yes! Very well, in fact.
【Misaki】
Well, let's have a good one, yeah?
【Asuka】
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it!
【Misaki】
Same.
The two of them fall silent.
【Misaki】
......
【Asuka】
......
It feels like they've both stopped breathing and even made their hearts still.
For a moment, the entire area seems to stop, like it's been covered with a sheet of glass.
Even the sound of the waves feel distant.
The horn blares on the referee's signal, and everything comes alive. Applause and cheers ring out from the crowd.
The final match has begun.
【Asuka】
Ah...!
【Misaki】
Ah...!
Asuka gets ahead on the first line, which is only natural for an All-Rounder in this situation. Misaki proceeds to jump to the second line.
【Masaya】
The start of this is essential. You know that, right?
【Misaki】
Sure do!
Asuka has kept the height advantage in every match she's played this tournament. That's basically what she's used to win.
But what will she do when that doesn't happen?
She's gotten this far without revealing it.
So the first thing we have to do is get her to show it off.
Misaki circles above the second line as she waits.
【Asuka】
There!
Asuka touches the buoy. 0:1.
【Asuka】
Misaki-chan...
Asuka stares up at Misaki.
【Misaki】
......
Misaki remains vigilant as she continues to circle to maintain her speed.
Asuka has three possible options.
Fly along the line and aim for third. Fly up to Misaki and challenge her to a dogfight. Jump to the third line.
Which will she pick?
【Asuka】
Ah...!
Asuka remains tense as she looks up at Misaki.
But she doesn't move.
This is strange...
【Misaki】
What's Asuka thinking?
【Masaya】
That's what I wanna-- Oh, I get it!
【Misaki】
Get what?
【Masaya】
I know you're serious, Misaki, but so is Asuka.
【Misaki】
What do you mean?
【Masaya】
Asuka's already scored a point. She's in the lead. Her silence is her way of asserting control over the match.
【Misaki】
Wait, what?
【Masaya】
She's basically saying she's fine with you just keeping the height advantage and not attacking.
【Misaki】
Ohhh, I get it. I'm in the lead, so if you wanna win, you'll have to come and fight me. That right?
This doesn't feel like a tactic Asuka would employ.
I glance to my side.
【Satouin】
......
Did Satouin-san order this?
【Asuka】
......
I stare up at Asuka. She's so tense that you can see it.
【Masaya】
Misaki, are you afraid of Asuka?
【Misaki】
I told you earlier, didn't I? Of course I am.
【Masaya】
Well, it's the same for her.
【Misaki】
What?
【Masaya】
Asuka's scared of you. That's why she's not moving. She's waiting and observing.
I'm sure, in a corner of her mind...
She's hoping the match will just end like this without anything actually happening.
We're talking about Asuka here, so it's definitely a very small feeling. But it's a feeling anyone would have.
【Asuka】
......
Though part of her will be hoping nothing happens...
There is one more side to the story.
That the two of them, who are tense and still as statues...
Might be enjoying themselves.
Or at least, I imagine that's how they feel.
On one hand, they're scared. On the other, they're enjoying themselves.
Isn't that how I'm feeling right now?
I doubt Asuka's alone in feeling this way.
Misaki, Satouin, and I all feel the same.
Hell, maybe even the people watching this match do.
Mashiro, Madoka, Shirase-san, Prez, Mask, Aoi-san, Ichinose-san, Shindou-san...
Scared, but enjoying it.
In which case, the fun needs to win out.
【Masaya】
Have fun, Misaki.
【Misaki】
Wh-Where's this coming from?
【Masaya】
Aren't you enjoying this?
【Misaki】
Of <i>course</i> I'm enjoying this.
Misaki's voice resounds through my headset.
Oh...
Goosebumps rise all over my body as I come to a sudden realization about what Misaki said before the match.
About how the feeling of wanting to win was what was most important to her.
That's what she said.
I sort of got what she meant at the time, but now it's perfectly clear.
The result is just something that follows along from that feeling.
A match isn't something you take part in to win. And it's not something you just do because you don't want to lose, either...
Well, I mean, it <i>is</i> something you take part in to win, and do not want to lose, but the feeling of wanting to win is more important than the actual results.
Though saying the feeling is important feels wrong. There's a more specific word for it.
Love. It's love.
I love the feeling of wanting to win.
I think that's what Misaki was trying to say. I think that's why she plays these matches.
I know Misaki meant every word she said before the match.
She's finally realized how special wanting to win is, and she's okay with that.
But I've always struggled. I was left smoldering. That's how I ended up this way, crushed under the weight of an emotion far more horrible than jealousy.
Misaki was in the same boat as me...
And yet, before her match with Inui...
She thanked me.
"Thanks for getting me here, Masaya".
Did I help Misaki reach this point?
If so, I want to boast about it. I want to tell everyone how amazing Misaki is.
I feel something forcing its way up from deep inside me.
I'm about to cry.
【Masaya】
I love you, Misaki.
【Misaki】
Y-You realize we're in the middle of a match, don't you...?! I love you too, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Good. You wanna have more fun with this match, right?
【Misaki】
'Course I do!
Of course.
【Masaya】
And so do I.
I wonder if Asuka and Satouin-san feel the same way?
What am I saying? I'm sure they do.
And if they don't, we'll just drag them into it.
【Masaya】
Listen up, I want you to slowly approach Asuka from above and put the pressure on her.
【Misaki】
So I should try to push her down toward the water?
【Masaya】
Exactly. But I doubt Asuka will let that happen. She'll try to take the top position from you. We have time, so close the gap slowly.
【Misaki】
Roger!
Misaki carefully narrows the distance.
【Asuka】
......
Hm?
It seems like Asuka's tension has dispersed.
Is she relieved that the match is heating up?
【Misaki】
......
【Asuka】
......
Asuka doesn't flee as Misaki approaches.
【Masaya】
Don't grow timid. Close combat is exactly what you want.
I'm sure Asuka has a strategy, but close combat is Misaki's domain.
If we cower here, we have no chance of winning.
【Misaki】
......
【Asuka】
......
Misaki and Asuka lock eyes.
Then, Misaki starts talking to me through the headset.
【Misaki】
Asuka's a straightforward girl, so I can tell.
【Masaya】
Tell what?
【Misaki】
That she's got something up her sleeve.
【Masaya】
Concentrate. She's sure to go all in once she gets moving.
【Misaki】
Mhm...
Things can change in an instant.
If Misaki draws any closer, a dogfight will start.
And so, she comes to a halt.
She's planning to gather her breath, then go in for the kill.
But that seems to be a mistake.
Having the height advantage gives her security, but not knowing what Asuka will do next has her anxious.
Both of those feelings are telling Misaki to be cautious, which was what made her stop.
【Misaki】
Huh...?! Asuka vanished!
【Masaya】
SuMo!
【Misaki】
Ah...!
Misaki doesn't know what's going on, but quickly pulls into inverted flight.
【Misaki】
Aaah!
【Asuka】
Huh...?!
Asuka touches Misaki's stomach. The recoil creates a fair bit of distance between them.
Misaki is falling, back toward the ocean. Asuka is rising, back toward the sky.
【Asuka】
Hm...?
It happened right when Misaki was turning onto her back, leaving her completely shocked.
【Asuka】
Ah...!
Asuka doesn't attack, seemingly having decided to just hold the height advantage.
【Masaya】
Keep up the SuMo.
【Misaki】
What just happened? It looked like Asuka vanished.
【Masaya】
Asuka just slipped past your side at a ridiculous speed.
【Misaki】
What? But Asuka's wearing All-Rounder Grav Shoes, isn't she? How'd she manage that?
【Masaya】
She's applying the Angelic Halo technique. Though it doesn't feel perfect or anything...
【Misaki】
Angelic Halo... You mentioned that before, right?
【Masaya】
You interfere with the movement of your suit's membrane, allowing you to get a momentary burst of high speed.
【Misaki】
Wow, why isn't everyone using something as amazing as that?
【Masaya】
It's hard to pull off. <i>Really</i> hard. The only one in the world who's ever pulled off a perfect Angelic Halo is Aoi-san.
【Misaki】
So Asuka learned it from Ms. Kagami.
【Masaya】
Probably. But you don't need to worry. That was nowhere close to a true Angelic Halo. Asuka still can't use it, so we can deal with her speed.
【Misaki】
You sure?
【Masaya】
Yeah. We basically have to counter it just like we would with an Airkick Turn or a Cobra.
【Misaki】
Those are pretty hard to counter, y'know?
【Masaya】
Don't let it get you down. We're trying to find out what tricks Asuka's hiding, remember? Now it's time for the real match to begin. We'll proceed as planned.
【Misaki】
Use SuMo and attack from below?
【Masaya】
Yep! Attack from below, from below, from below. Always from below.
【Misaki】
Roger!
【Masaya】
Once it starts, I won't be giving any more instructions.
I won't be fast enough when they get into close quarter dogfights.
【Misaki】
I know. Believe in me, Masaya.
【Masaya】
I believe in you. Go, Misaki!
【Misaki】
I <i>will</i> win!
Misaki faces Asuka while flying inverted.
Asuka manages to stave off Misaki's continued attacks from below.
【Misaki】
Whoa! Take this...! There!
【Asuka】
Huh?! Eeek! Ngh!
I can hear the two of them screaming.
【Misaki】
This time for sure!
Misaki pulls past Asuka's side, then tries to reach out and touch Asuka from above.
【Asuka】
Oh no you don't!
How'd she pull that off so quickly?!
Asuka used an Airkick Turn to change her trajectory, dodging Misaki's hand while pulling up into an ascent.
【Misaki】
I'm not done yet!
Misaki chases after Asuka a moment later.
Asuka uses Airkick Turns, Cobras, and her imperfect Angelic Halos to dodge Misaki. They're all techniques that abuse the membrane.
However, those skills only give her a momentary burst of speed. Misaki can more than keep up.
Misaki keeps on challenging her to close range dogfights. Whenever Asuka attempts to give her the slip, Misaki immediately appears right below her again, keeping them face to face.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah...
This keeps Asuka from doing anything too flashy, and stops them from being locked in a battle for the height advantage.
They say that Skywalkers often share moments only they can ever understand during matches.
【Asuka】
You're incredible, Misaki-chan! The way you fight is amazing.
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah... Yeah, 'cause I don't wanna lose!
That moment immediately shatters as Misaki continues to attack from below.
She attacks and attacks and attacks until the next moment arrives.
【Asuka】
I-I don't want to lose either!
【Misaki】
I sure hope not!
I wonder if this'll be the last moment they share up there...
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah, haaah... I won't let up!
Misaki continues to attack. The moment I think she's reached her limit, she bursts forward again.
To think Misaki, who started with absolutely no stamina, can fly like this.
It's almost enough to make me want to tell her she doesn't need to try so hard.
But I can't say that. I don't want to hurt her. I can't even imagine how much I'd wound her if I told her to stop.
So instead, I'll say the only thing I can.
【Masaya】
Concentrate! Concentrate! Your chance will come! Don't let it slip by!
Her chances will come, but there won't be many of them.
We're already losing 0:1. If we let any slip, we'll lose the whole match.
【Misaki】
I don't wanna lose! I wanna win! I don't wanna lose!
I doubt even Misaki knows why she feels that way. But hey, it doesn't really matter.
Where's our chance...? Where is it?
Even Asuka isn't perfect.
In fact, it doesn't matter who you are. Nobody can go a whole match without leaving some openings.
We just have to wait for our moment.
And when it comes, we need to take full advantage of it!
【Misaki】
Haaah, haaah, haaah... Huh?!
Misaki's panting has thrown her inverted flight out of whack. Her abs are growing tired, leaving her unable to maintain proper form.
Will Asuka attack?
If we go two points down now, we're done.
However, Asuka doesn't attack.
Maybe she thinks Misaki's trying to pull off a feint? Nah, I doubt that's the case.
I think Asuka has something she wants to try out.
Namely, her strategy of fleeing from inverted flight using her imperfect Angelic Halo.
【Asuka】
Huh?
The perfect chance has arrived.
She messed up that Angelic Halo, so she's spinning off to the side.
Her membrane's moving her in the wrong direction.
I could feel inexperience in her hand movements. I knew this moment would happen sooner or later.
【Misaki】
Ah...!
Misaki stretches out as she flies up.
【Masaya】
GOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Her right arm swings down like a whip.
【Misaki】
REAAAAAAAAAAAACH!
【Asuka】
Oh no!
Misaki's hand connects with Asuka's back.
There's an explosion of applause.
【Masaya】
Low Yo-Yo!
【Misaki】
Okay!
Misaki immediately corrects her posture and turns into a nosedive.
Third is right in front of her.
【Misaki】
Ah...!
However, Misaki hesitates as she approaches it.
Bet she's thinking this isn't the right way to end this match.
She wants to settle it in a dogfight.
And I get how she feels.
She turns her head to see...
【Asuka】
Ah...!
Asuka charging toward her at full speed.
【Masaya】
The buoy! Touch it! Touch it! The two of you are gonna end up hurt if you go easy on her!
【Misaki】
I-I know!
Misaki touches third, then uses the recoil to shoot down the third line and escape from Asuka.
【Asuka】
Ah...!
How much time do we have left?
I pushed Misaki to fly as fast as she could for this very moment.
But flying full speed won't buy her enough time to wear down the clock.
In which case...
【Masaya】
Do a half-rotation and push down on Asuka's head!
【Misaki】
Got it...! Here I go!
【Asuka】
Ah...!
The next moment...
Dazzling beams of light disperse throughout our surroundings.
Oh, this is it.
This is the end.
The time remaining is no issue, since the score is already settled.
This match is going to end in a head-on collision.
This is where those two girls have arrived.
The moment Asuka, lips pursed, crashes directly into Misaki...
The horn blares, signaling the end of the match.
Recoil sends Misaki drifting away from the field.
【Masaya】
We... won...
2:1.
The winner of the fall tournament is Misaki Tobisawa.
Deafening applause erupts from all around us.
Misaki challenged Asuka to a fight again and again, failing each time, until Asuka finally slipped up. Then, Misaki didn't let that chance go, and scored two consecutive points.
It was a messy match.
But the audience is cheering nonetheless.
Why?
Satouin-san covers her mic so Asuka can't hear her as she talks to me.
【Satouin】
Why do you look so confused?
I cover my mic as well.
【Masaya】
I'm wondering why people are cheering for such a messy match. Is it just because it's the grand finals?
【Satouin】
Whatever do you mean? Your player went all in on the attack and took advantage of the only chance afforded to her. That obviously deserves congratulating.
【Masaya】
...I see.
【Satouin】
Perhaps you should congratulate Misaki Tobisawa as well?
I uncover my mic.
【Masaya】
Misaki?
【Misaki】
Hahahahaha...
【Masaya】
Congrats, Misaki. You won.
【Misaki】
Yeah. Yeah... I won. I guess today really is my day after all. But, y'know...
【Masaya】
Hm?
【Misaki】
I'm real happy about this match and the one with Inui, but doesn't this whole thing scream like, "to be continued"? I won, as far as winning goes, but that's all I managed.
【Masaya】
Like, you won the battle, but lost the war?
【Misaki】
Yeah, that's kinda how it feels.
【Masaya】
You better leave that between the two of us. Winners can't go around making excuses. Losers make excuses to help them deal with their losses after the fact. If they see a winner making excuses, they'll get angry.
【Misaki】
I guess so, yeah.
【Masaya】
Though, I doubt either Inui or Asuka will make any excuses.
【Misaki】
Yeah.
Oh...
I see Asuka approaching Misaki, so I end our conversation.
【Asuka】
Misaki-chan!
【Misaki】
Y-Yes?!
Asuka calls out to Misaki energetically, and Misaki responds in kind.
【Asuka】
I never knew people could fly like that.
【Misaki】
O-Oh, well, Masaya and the others sort of invented it...
【Asuka】
Please teach me! I want to know all about it! I want to try flying in all sorts of different ways!
【Misaki】
...Sure. But in exchange, you've gotta teach me how to manipulate the membrane like you do. I've never even thought about it before.
【Asuka】
Okay! Also... Also... Let's continue where we left off right now!
【Misaki】
Hahahahaha, right now? You just can't wait, huh?
【Asuka】
No. It turns out I hate losing more than I realized.
【Misaki】
You wanna win, huh?
【Asuka】
I do.
【Misaki】
Same. So let's do it. I'm ready whenever. Also... there's one thing I kinda just noticed...
【Asuka】
What's that?
【Misaki】
Aren't we pretty damn awesome?
【Asuka】
Yes!
【Misaki】
Hahahahaha.
【Asuka】
Haha, hahahaha.
【Misaki】
Thank you, Asuka.
【Asuka】
Oh no, thank you. I'm looking forward to working together again!
【Misaki】
Yeah... Same here!
【Shion】
Waaaaaah! Waaaaaah!
【Shirase】
You act all stoic through the whole match, but start wailing <i>now?</i>
【Shion】
Only a robot wouldn't start bawling after seeing that, Shirase-san!
【Shirase】
I'm almost jealous that you can cry like that...
【Minamo】
Clubs... are wonderful, Big Brother...
【Shirase】
Yeah, they are. I hope you can create a club like that too, Minamo.
【Minamo】
Yeah... I'll do my best...
【Shion】
Waaaaaah! Waaaaaah! Tobisawa and Kurashina did so well!
【Mashiro】
Ms. Kagami! We can go see them now, right?!
【Aoi】
Yes, go congratulate the two... No, go congratulate the four of them.
【Mashiro】
I can charge at Misaki-senpai, switch off her Grav Shoes, push her to the ground, and rain kisses down on her, right?! I mean, she <i>did</i> win!
【Aoi】
Don't ask me. Just go do it.
【Madoka】
That's what happens to the winner here...? You're one scary girl, Mashirocchi.
【Mashiro】
I'm heading over!
【Madoka】
Wait for me!
【Mashiro】
I will not!
【Madoka】
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
【Aoi】
Congrats... Masaya.
【Rika】
President, if I work really, really, really, <i>really</i> hard, will I... ever be able to fly like the two of them?
【Shindou】
You won't.
【Rika】
I thought as much...
【Shindou】
But you don't have to. FC is a broad sport. The day we can beat them may arrive sooner than you think. I always go into matches with winning in mind, and so should you.
【Rika】
Can I still try that hard? I won't regret it, will I? I'm scared of putting in all that effort for nothing...
【Shindou】
You won't know if you'll regret it or not until all is said and done.
【Rika】
I'm... fine with regretting it. I just want to put in the effort. No... I will. I <i>will</i> put in the effort.
【Shindou】
If you want to do something from the bottom of your heart, then you have to do it. That's what I think.
【Rika】
I'm going to keep playing FC.
【Misaki】
What?!
【Mashiro】
Misaki-senpai!
A crowd of people have gathered to congratulate Misaki and Asuka. I stay long enough to watch Mashiro break through the crowd and pull off a magnificent Suicida into Misaki.
...Where the hell'd she learn to do that? Maybe she'd make a better Fighter than I thought.
Okay, now...
After walking away from the crowds, I pull out my phone.
【Masaya】
Ah...!
【Shindou】
What's up?
【Masaya】
You're at the tournament, right?
【Shindou】
I am. It seems congratulations are in order. It was a great match.
【Masaya】
Thank you very much.
【Shindou】
You smashed through both Inui-kun and Kurashina-kun. Your tactics were amazing, Hinata-kun, as was Tobisawa-kun for putting them into practice.
【Masaya】
...Thanks.
【Shindou】
You raised an annoying player, just like I said before.
【Masaya】
Mind talking for a bit?
【Shindou】
That's fine by me, but shouldn't you be congratulating Tobisawa-kun and Kurashina-kun right now?
【Masaya】
Nah, a bunch of other people are talking to them right now. Where are you? Do you mind speaking in person?
【Shindou】
Sure. I'm still by the main building.
【Masaya】
I'll be right there.
Shindou-san stands before me with that same invigorating smile he had on the day we first met.
【Shindou】
So, what's up?
However, his tone is unusually serious.
Guess he's figured out what's troubling me.
【Masaya】
Do you remember how you asked me to be your training partner?
【Shindou】
Of course.
【Masaya】
Well, my body...
【Shindou】
Is there something wrong with your body?
【Masaya】
Guess you can say that. There's this dark, sticky thing inside it. It clings to me and stops me from moving freely.
【Shindou】
What does that mean?
【Masaya】
To put it simply, jealousy. But it's a far more complicated emotion than just that.
【Shindou】
The second of the victor is jealous? It'd make more sense if people were jealous of you.
【Masaya】
At first, I thought I was jealous of Asuka. Then, I thought I was jealous of Misaki. But I was wrong.
【Shindou】
......
【Masaya】
I'm jealous of Inui, of you, of Prez, of Mashiro and Ichinose and Satouin-san... I'm jealous of everyone who plays FC.
【Shindou】
Everyone, huh? That's impressive. Though I suppose I should expect no less from you, Hinata-kun.
【Masaya】
Expect what you want. I just feel like screaming. Why can everyone fly when I can't?!
【Shindou】
Why don't you just fly?
【Masaya】
Exactly! Why don't I?! Do you know how many years it's been?
【Shindou】
Honestly, I do know how many years it's been, but I don't want to tell you.
【Masaya】
I don't think I can fly properly anymore. It scares me. I'm scared of how different I'll be. I'm scared of everyone's expectations. Won't I be a lot weaker than I once was?
【Shindou】
You won't know that unless you try.
【Masaya】
Not knowing scares me too. I'm scared of everything. But what I'm most scared of is... Misaki.
【Shindou】
Of Tobisawa-kun?
【Masaya】
Misaki was flying for my sake, not for her own. I'm so happy I could cry. That's why I want to do something to return the favor, no matter what it is.
【Shindou】
......
【Masaya】
Misaki flies in no small part because I forced her to get back into it. I forced her to take practice seriously, I forced her to become determined. Though, I bet she'd say she did it of her own free will.
【Shindou】
......
【Masaya】
But there's no doubt in my mind that it only happened because I forced her to. And then, Misaki went and won the whole tournament for the two of us. She's just too incredible!
【Shindou】
You're right. Tobisawa-kun is incredible.
【Masaya】
Assuming I make my comeback, I don't think there's anything more I can do for Misaki. And what scares me most is... I'm... I'm afraid that I'll never beat her.
【Shindou】
Did you want Tobisawa-kun to win? In fact, what was it you wanted to begin with?
【Masaya】
Huh? Well... I wanted Misaki to recover from her frustration.
【Shindou】
So, what is it you want from me?
【Masaya】
Well, um... I don't know. I just thought I could speak to you about all this.
【Shindou】
I'm thinking of competing in a foreign league. Ms. Kagami got me an invite.
【Masaya】
She did?
【Shindou】
Whether or not you can fly again isn't for me to decide.
【Masaya】
I know that.
【Shindou】
But the one thing I can tell you is that it's okay to be afraid.
【Masaya】
It is?
【Shindou】
Overcoming your fears is fun, I think.
【Masaya】
...Right.
【Shindou】
You have to decide this for yourself, Hinata-kun. Don't rely on me.
【Masaya】
I know.
I look Shindou-san firmly in the eyes as I say that.
He smiles.
I'm going to decide for myself. I've made my mind up.
It's sweltering. The sun's glistening off the sandy beach.
The calendar says it's fall, but most people would probably assume it's summer based on the weather.
【Masaya】
Almost didn't make it in time.
There's a single figure in the sky above the coast. A girl who's doing some field flying. Misaki Tobisawa.
The breeze blows in from the sea.
The moment it brushes against my neck, a flood of memories rush through my head.
I loved how my hair would cling to the membrane, then come unstuck and flutter in the wind.
【Masaya】
......
I raise a hand to the back of my neck.
I used to love the feel of my hair tickling me in this spot.
My hair would always tickle me here when I played FC. That's why I loved playing.
They're memories of fun times. Times where I was totally engrossed in flying.
However...
Recalling them now makes my chest hurt. I brought time to a standstill to escape from that pain.
I want time to start moving again... No, that's not quite right.
I want to start over from the beginning. To start from the feeling of enjoying soaring through the sky.
I want to fly with my heart full of the same joy I felt the very first time.
I think back.
What was it that Misaki told me on the day we met that one summer? How did she feel when she called out to me for that first time?
Was she nervous like I am now? Or did she just feel completely normal?
I imagine it was the latter. After all, it didn't take much courage.
【Masaya】
Misaki!
【Misaki】
Oh, Masaya!
Misaki descends toward me.
【Misaki】
Something's been up with you lately. Why'd you tell me to come practice here alone?
【Masaya】
L-Look...
【Misaki】
Hm?
【Masaya】
Um...
【Misaki】
Y-Yeah?
【Misaki】
Hellooo! Hellooo!
When'd they get there?
There's someone unfamiliar standing on the beach, looking up at me. They're waving furiously to get my attention.
I approach them.
【Masaya】
What's up?
I can see that their eyes are sparkling.
【Misaki】
Is that fun? I'd like to give it a try...
They smile bashfully at me.
【Misaki】
Please let me fly!
Surprised though I am by their sudden request, I puff out my chest and say...
【Masaya】
Sure. This is known as Flying Circus.
【Misaki】
Flying... Circus?
【Masaya】
It's the name of the best sport in the world!
【Masaya】
Is it fun?
【Misaki】
Hm? Yeah, it is. Where'd that come from?
【Masaya】
Can I try?
【Misaki】
Huh? Oh, sure...
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
Huh...? Mmmmmm?! I get it! I <i>totally</i> get it!
【Masaya】
If you get it, then get that mischievous glint out of your eye and just follow along with the conversation.
【Misaki】
Heheh, you picked a pretty risky way to show me that you've decided to make your comeback.
【Masaya】
How's it risky? It would've been too hard for me to say it any other way. I couldn't just come out and say it. I had to make a whole thing of it, force myself into a situation where I <i>had</i> to say it... Otherwise, I'd just stay silent.
【Misaki】
You're such a cute little kitty, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Quit teasing me. I'm so embarrassed. God, I wanna die.
【Misaki】
Don't worry, I'll be nice to you... Go ahead and start again.
【Masaya】
...Let me fly too.
I want to fly. That's the only thought on my mind.
But I'm still so scared of flying. Everything about it makes me anxious... No, that doesn't matter. I want to fly.
Misaki does a little twirl, then gives me a big nod.
【Misaki】
Sure, I'll let you. But I have one condition.
【Masaya】
What is it?
【Misaki】
You can't get frustrated when you find something hard or painful.
【Masaya】
I won't.
【Misaki】
Oh yeah? Then I'll give you permission to fly.
【Masaya】
Thanks... I am a bit scared, though.
【Misaki】
Cool. That's a good thing.
【Masaya】
Being scared is <i>good?</i>
【Misaki】
Yeah, 'cause fear's a powerful emotion. You can use it to make your other emotions stronger too.
【Masaya】
What do you mean?
Shindou-san said that overcoming your fear was fun.
【Misaki】
If you're afraid, you'll put in more effort and work harder. If you fly while afraid, you're going to fight to get used to it faster.
Misaki...
Misaki is incredible.
How many times have I thought that by now?
I haven't even told her that much about how I feel, but she understands everything.
I still have that dark amoeba like thing seeping through me.
But Misaki is telling me to use it to fly.
Misaki is telling me that it's okay to feel like this.
And now that she's told me this...
There's something I want to say to her in return... Something with my feelings behind it.
However, I can only think of the simplest phrase. One that has consumed my entire being.
【Masaya】
I love you, Misaki.
【Misaki】
I know. I love you too, Masaya.
【Masaya】
I'm completely serious about all this.
【Misaki】
Hahahahaha, how about you purrove that instead of just telling me?
【Masaya】
Good point...
I brace myself, choosing my next words carefully.
【Masaya】
Let's start by going up to the first line.
【Misaki】
Huh? We're going straight into a match?
【Masaya】
Figured I should work out how good I am first.
【Misaki】
Aight! Sounds like a good place to start to me.
Misaki flies up to the field, then looks down at me.
【Misaki】
Let's do this, Masaya!
I give her a huge nod.
【Masaya】
FLY!
I float up, like I'm being sucked up into that blue sky.
This is what it feels like to fly in the field.
My body remembers the sensation. Happiness begins to gush upward from deep within.
A shiver runs through me.
This is what flying feels like.
【Misaki】
It's my turn to help you now, Masaya, so don't worry. Just follow me.
【Masaya】
I can't not worry.
【Misaki】
I get that. I mean, I was worried too.
【Masaya】
Really?
【Misaki】
Yep! But I still made it, so... you'll be fine.
She smiles at me. And I know I'm smiling right back.
【Misaki】
Come on, Masaya.
It feels like a whole host of emotions, as broad as the blue sky, are being sucked out of me.
All of them, the good, the bad, are being absorbed into Misaki's smile.
【Rika】
......
【Masaya】
......
...Well, we're neighbors, so this sort of thing is bound to happen every once in a while.
【Rika】
Wh-Where are you going?
Hm? I just had a feeling of deja vu.
【Rika】
Why do you look so confused?
【Masaya】
Didn't the same thing happen about a year ago?
【Rika】
Did it?
【Masaya】
We went to Iron Mall on Fukuru Island and bumped into Satouin-san, remember?
【Rika】
We met Satouin-senpai...? Oh, yes! We ate fried chicken together.
【Masaya】
Pretty similar to what's happening now, right?
【Rika】
Oh, yes. Are you going to Iron Mall today, then?
【Masaya】
No, unfortunately... Um, I probably shouldn't say unfortunately...
Ichinose giggles.
【Rika】
You can just come out and say it.
【Masaya】
I have plans with Misaki.
【Rika】
Tobisawa-san? Ohhh, a date, huh? You two are as lovey-dovey as usual.
【Masaya】
Things are going well, yeah.
【Rika】
They are? How nice. I'm jealous.
Ichinose shrugs her shoulders and smiles.
【Rika】
So, you have the day off as well?
【Masaya】
What, Takafuji's on break right now?
【Rika】
We're at peak exhaustion.
It's the week before the summer tournament. Fatigue has just about reached its maximum, so all we can do is practice in moderation to preserve ourselves for the big day.
This is the simplest method of making sure you'll be in good shape.
【Rika】
I thought I'd go shopping with some friends... Oh, did you hear about Shindou-senpai?
【Masaya】
Of course. I knew he'd do well, but... let's just say I never thought he'd develop his own style instead of adapting to the league he was joining.
【Rika】
He's a very strong willed person, so I actually expected as much.
Shindou-san joined the Northern Europe League, which is known for having many players who excel at dogfighting. However, he didn't adapt to their playstyle.
Instead, he developed his own unique style. Instead of using his speed like a Speeder normally would, he used it in dogfights to essentially overpower his opponents with speed no matter the situation.
I think that's the answer Shindou-san found after his match with Inui.
【Rika】
I'm working hard so that people don't comment on how things have changed since Shindou-senpai left. Satouin-senpai's really giving it her all, too.
There's power behind her gaze.
【Rika】
None of us want to lose... We want to overtake you.
【Masaya】
I don't want to lose to you either.
【Rika】
You sound confident. Are you so sure you can beat me if we meet?
【Masaya】
Not at all. I've been afraid since my comeback, wondering how far I can go.
【Rika】
...Not many people can admit to being scared.
【Masaya】
I've decided to fly without concealing my fear.
【Rika】
You're strong, Hinata-san. It takes a strong person to admit their fear.
I only seem that way thanks to Misaki. However, I feel like saying that would come across as boasting about my girlfriend, so I remain silent.
I ring the intercom.
【Misaki】
Whoa, you're here early! I'm coming!
I hear Misaki's voice through the door, not over the intercom.
I look at my phone to check the time. I'm not early. I'm right on time.
I only pressed the buzzer. What if I was just the mailman? That'd be embarrassing.
That blind courage <i>is</i> just like Misaki, though.
Speaking of her personality, she always hits this weird state of high concentration when she reaches a decisive moment, just like in the fall tournament.
No one other than her could continue to pull off wins at the very last second like that.
I look up into the deep blue sky.
【Masaya】
The summer tournament's just around the corner.
My shoulders tense slightly as the wind tickles the back of my neck.
【Misaki】
Hey there!
Misaki, looking flustered, suddenly appears.
【Misaki】
Sorry I made you wait... I suddenly thought, what if it's the mailman, and rushed around to find my stamp.
【Masaya】
...That was a waste of time.
【Misaki】
I spent the whole time thinking about how badly I wanted to see you... and how I should be doing that instead of looking for my stamp...
【Misaki】
It filled my heart with feelings for you, so it wasn't a waste of time at all. And so, now that my heart's full, I'm in perfect form today!
【Masaya】
Perfect form for what?
【Misaki】
Um, like, getting you to spoil me rotten?
She cuddles up to me.
【Misaki】
Me a hungwy kitty. Me want meowney.
【Masaya】
You really don't hold back, huh?
【Misaki】
Hahahahaha!
She links her arms behind her back and peers into my face.
【Misaki】
Where are you gonna take me today?
【Masaya】
Hm, how about we just go wander around the shopping district like normal?
【Misaki】
I get that like, the only places we can go are the shopping district or Iron Mall. I just wish every once in a while you'd whisk me off somewhere far away.
【Masaya】
Next time.
【Misaki】
Next time? I'm gonna be whisked away next time?! How exciting!
【Masaya】
Shirase-san convinced me to take part in that long distance race they're holding in Kyushu over the summer break.
【Misaki】
Lame!
【Masaya】
If we win the summer nationals, we'll get to compete on the world stage. It's a chance to go abroad.
【Misaki】
That's not what I want. I want us to be together and poke each other all over!
【Masaya】
...Is that some kind of secret martial arts technique they discovered at the far reaches of the Earth?
【Misaki】
I don't care about what happens at the far reaches of the Earth. I just wanna go on a trip and be all coupley the whole time!
【Masaya】
Don't say that out loud!
【Misaki】
Pokey, pokey, pokey!
Misaki starts poking and prodding me all over.
【Masaya】
Quit it, that tickles.
【Misaki】
You think there's a girlfriend out there who'd stop at that? Fat chance! Pokey!
Misaki suddenly links her arms behind her back again and peers into my face once more.
【Misaki】
...Do you wanna compete abroad?
【Masaya】
Well, I just thought I'd start by getting back to where I used to be... How about you?
【Misaki】
Of course I do! Wait, stop, no more of this! We're on a date today! Hm, so our choices are the shopping district or Iron Mall...
【Mashiro】
How about Mashiro Udon?
【Misaki】
Udon may be the best food in the universe, but who in their right mind starts off a date with it?
【Mashiro】
You can always just give up on the date and come to Mashiro Udon alone, Misaki-senpai.
【Misaki】
That... could work...
【Masaya】
No! Wait, what are you doing here, Mashiro?
【Mashiro】
My house is pretty close to Misaki-senpai's.
【Masaya】
That doesn't explain why you showed up at this exact moment.
【Mashiro】
You two have been practicing so much lately that I was sure you'd go out on a date today...
She puffs out her chest with pride.
【Mashiro】
I pretended I was out on a walk as I continuously strolled past Misaki-senpai's house just so I could get in the way of your date. It's a perfect crime.
【Masaya】
Not so perfect when you just admit it to our faces...
【Mashiro】
Please don't be so rude. This is a matter of the heart.
【Masaya】
So you have the heart of a criminal, too...
Well, she's certainly motivated.
【Masaya】
Why do you wanna get in our way, anyway?
【Mashiro】
I may approve of your relationship... but I'm worried that Misaki-senpai will forget about me if I don't.
【Misaki】
Mashiro...
Misaki suddenly spreads her arms wide and pulls Mashiro into a tight squeeze.
【Mashiro】
Whoa, whoa, whoa?! Wh-Why am I suddenly in paradise?
【Misaki】
I just thought it was unfair of me not to return the love you're always giving me.
【Mashiro】
W-Well, if this is how you return my love, then you get a lifetime pass to eat at Mashiro Udon for free!
【Masaya】
You'll regret saying things in the moment like that.
【Misaki】
Thanks, Mashiro.
Misaki relinquishes her from her grasp.
【Mashiro】
Haaah, haaah, if you'd gone any further, my heart would've given out.
【Masaya】
Don't go getting sick just before the tournament. You should be able to put on a good show this time around.
【Mashiro】
I won't get sick. I'm going to beat you, Masaya-senpai, and reclaim Misaki-senpai for myself!
【Misaki】
...Reclaim? So I used to belong to you?
【Mashiro】
Of course! Listen up! I want to get results for all my hard work! I don't want to keep dragging the two of you down!
Mashiro bows quickly, then dashes off into the distance.
【Misaki】
Hahahahaha!
【Masaya】
What's so funny?
【Misaki】
She just said "the two of you," like, including me, yeah? Mashiro's never treated me like that before. It's great.
【Masaya】
It is?
【Misaki】
She also said she doesn't wanna drag me down, which means she's taking FC seriously, and that means she finds it fun.
【Masaya】
If you think so, you must be right.
【Misaki】
She probably wanted us to know that before the summer tournament.
I get what it's like to want to tell someone how you feel about FC.
【Misaki】
Okay!
Misaki suddenly grabs hold of my wrist.
【Misaki】
Let's do our best at the summer tournament for Mashiro's sake!
She pulls my wrist into the air as she says that. It's almost like we're cheering.
【Misaki】
C'mon, you too, Masaya. Mashiro can probably still hear us.
She pulls my wrist up once again.
【Misaki】
Let's do our best for Mashiro's sake!
【Masaya】
Let's do our best!
I scream out with her.
Now that I've said that, the reality of how close the tournament is has finally dawned on me.
Misaki squeezes my wrist.
【Misaki】
Um... is it okay if I just... move my hand down into your palm?
【Masaya】
G-Go ahead...
Misaki slowly lets go of my wrist.
【Misaki】
I-I'm gonna do it!
【Masaya】
Why are you so nervous? We've held hands a bunch.
【Misaki】
Hahahaha... Holding hands with someone you love always makes you nervous.
【Masaya】
Is that how it works?
【Misaki】
I start thinking things like, "My hand's not dry, is it? It's not all damp, is it? What if he hates me 'cause of it?" y'know?
【Masaya】
You really think I'd hate you over that?
【Misaki】
No, but... it still worries me.
Misaki breaths a short sigh.
【Misaki】
Time to start our date!
She swings our hands to and fro as she makes that declaration.
Misaki's in high spirits as we walk through the shopping district, having just knocked out a high score in the rhythm game she hasn't played in a while.
【Misaki】
Fast food for lunch, shopping, dessert at a cafe, then the arcade! Today was so great! It's all pretty vanilla, but they're common 'cause they're fun.
【Masaya】
Guess so.
【Misaki】
Though, I bet I'd have fun anywhere when I'm with you.
【Masaya】
Same.
【Misaki】
Oh, so you'd have fun being with yourself now, huh?
【Masaya】
When'd I get a doppelganger?
【Misaki】
What, we're talking philosophical now? Can't say I really care about that, but good luck, Masaya!
【Masaya】
Quit spouting nonsense!
It looks like she's having fun, which is great, but she's in a weird mood. I think she may be trying to force herself to relax.
【Minamo】
Oh...
【Masaya】
Hm?
【Misaki】
It's Minamo-chan.
【Minamo】
Ah...!
She spins around and runs away.
【Misaki】
Huh? Wait up!
I follow Misaki as she gives chase.
【Masaya】
You didn't say anything weird to her during our last joint practice session, did you?
At the start of the new school year, the Kamidorisha FC Club gained four new members. We've had several joint practice sessions with them since.
【Misaki】
No, of course not. We get along great!
I do see them chatting after practice all the time, and I never heard anything about any trouble.
【Misaki】
Wait! Mask!
【Minamo】
Huh?!
Minamo-chan's legs get all tangled up, and she manages to catch her foot on a tiny bump in the pavement.
【Minamo】
Eeek!
【Misaki】
A-A-Are you okay?
【Masaya】
You're not hurt, are you?
We help her back to her feet.
【Minamo】
I told you not to say anything about the mask!
【Misaki】
Sorry.
【Minamo】
Why did you chase after me?!
【Misaki】
Well, umm... Why'd you run away from us in the first place?
【Minamo】
...Because of what my brother said during the fall tournament. How I couldn't be around you if I wanted a serious match with you.
【Misaki】
There's still a week until the tournament, though.
【Minamo】
There's... <i>only</i> a week... I like you, and I like Masaya-san, but... this time... I'm... serious...
【Misaki】
I see... I'm sorry for chasing you!
Misaki bows her head deeply.
【Minamo】
Oh no... Um, you don't need to apologize.
【Misaki】
I should've realized when you ran away... There <i>is</i> only a week left.
【Minamo】
Yes there... is... I'm taking this seriously...
【Misaki】
I'm taking this seriously too.
【Minamo】
Good.
Misaki and Minamo-chan both nod, then turn their backs on each other in perfect sync.
【Misaki】
Let's go, Masaya.
【Masaya】
Mhm.
【Misaki】
......
We walk in silence.
You'd think the noise would be overwhelming in the shopping district, but for some reason, none of it reaches my ears.
【Masaya】
Don't go doing anything reckless. Excessive training at this point is counterproductive.
【Misaki】
Just focusing on trying to improve my concentration is fine, right?
【Masaya】
You'd do it even if I told you not to, right?
【Misaki】
...Yep.
【Masaya】
Wanna go see the sea?
【Misaki】
Yeah.
【Masaya】
Give me your hand.
【Misaki】
Okay.
I begin to walk, pulling Misaki along behind me.
【Misaki】
...Ah!
【Masaya】
Ahhh...
With the tournament so close, I understand the feeling of wanting to just get out there and move. It's hard to settle down otherwise.
【Asuka】
......
Still, I also know it's bad to fly when you're supposed to be resting.
【Asuka】
...Ah!
Asuka notices us while she's doing some field flying. Man, she looks like a kid who's been caught with their hand in the cookie jar.
【Masaya】
Get down here, Asuka!
【Asuka】
O-Okay...
Asuka descends toward us and turns off her Grav Shoes.
【Asuka】
I didn't think you'd spot me.
【Masaya】
You know you shouldn't be practicing.
【Asuka】
I thought a little wouldn't hurt...
【Misaki】
How long have you been practicing?
【Asuka】
Only about... three hours, I think?
【Masaya】
That's <i>way</i> too long! I don't wanna face you in the tournament unless you're at full strength, understand?
【Misaki】
Calm down. What's done is done.
【Asuka】
I just want to work as hard as I can... It's hard to hold back, so I...
She falls silent for a while, then smiles sweetly.
【Asuka】
I wish the summer tournament would start already.
【Misaki】
Yeah.
Misaki's smile is radiant as she nods.
【Asuka】
Inui-san's competing in this one, and she hasn't gone to any tournaments since the fall one.
【Masaya】
Y'know, I've heard Satouin-san's been trying all sorts of things to imitate Shindou-san's new style.
【Asuka】
This is all so exciting!
【Misaki】
I'm excited too.
【Masaya】
Same here... I'm also kinda scared, though.
【Asuka】
Of course you are.
【Masaya】
...You scared too, Asuka?
【Asuka】
I wouldn't have broken my promise and practiced today if I wasn't.
【Misaki】
I know the feeling. Hehehe, I'm scared too.
【Asuka】
Being scared is fun.
The way Asuka feels...
I'm sure it's how we all felt during the fall tournament grand finals.
【Asuka】
I wish the summer tournament would start already.
【Misaki】
We're almost there.
The two girls share a smile.
Misaki stares at Asuka as she goes off into the distance.
【Misaki】
I <i>totally</i> get how Asuka feels.
【Masaya】
Same here.
【Misaki】
Of course you do...
I look inward.
Countless problems swirl around inside me, many that I'm barely even conscious of. They itch at me, leaving me unable to stand still.
【Misaki】
How's your comeback feeling? Did I... get you there, Masaya? Have you made it?
【Masaya】
I have.
I'm at a point where I can move forward without averting my eyes from the jumbled mess of emotions inside me.
I now fly with those feelings. Hell, you could even say I fly <i>because</i> I have those feelings.
【Misaki】
You made it... That's great. I'm... worried. I'm scared of all the people who'll be coming to the summer tournament, aiming to beat me. Am I really that good?
【Masaya】
You can fly because you're worried. That's how you feel, so just take those feelings and fly with them as you are.
【Misaki】
As I am...
【Masaya】
Carry those worries into your match... and use them to help you win. Questioning yourself could hurt your mental game, but you can only grow by overcoming those issues.
【Misaki】
Wow, look at Mr. Optimist over here.
【Masaya】
I'm only repeating what you taught me.
【Misaki】
Oh really?
【Masaya】
Yeah, really.
Misaki stares at me, seemingly amazed, before forming a slight smile.
【Misaki】
...What'll you do if you end up facing me in the tournament?
【Masaya】
I'll win. So you better hit me with your best shot. I'm sure we'll still love each other no matter the results.
【Misaki】
Part of me wants to lose to the person I love, but that's not enough to make me go easy on you.
【Masaya】
I wouldn't want it any other way.
【Misaki】
Aight!
【Masaya】
What?
Misaki turns toward the sea as we stand alone on this beach.
【Misaki】
I'm gonna win! I'll give it everything I've got! I'll face Masaya with all of my love! I'll give it everything, everything, and I mean <i>everything</i> I've got!
【Masaya】
Good. That's the Misaki I wanna have a match with.
【Misaki】
What, you <i>just</i> want a match?
【Masaya】
Hm?
【Misaki】
I love you with everything I have, Masaya, so... I don't really know how to put this, b-but you know how it is!
【Masaya】
I love... everything about you, Misaki. And I'm gonna continue to date all of you!
【Misaki】
Hahahahaha, okay. Yeah!
I take Misaki's hand in mine.
Then, we look up at the red sky together.
I have so many feelings running through my mind that I can't put them into words.
However, I'm confident that the way I feel is getting to her through our connected hands.
I look over at Misaki's face as she stares silently up at the sky.
【Misaki】
......
I swear, I feel like I could fly forever as long as I have her by my side.
I bet I could even travel beyond the sky.
I'm convinced.
The wind blows past us.
It tickles the back of my neck.... Man, I love this feeling.
...Okay, it's time to fly.
From now on, I'll move forward without ever letting go of these feelings Misaki's helped me understand.
