Time for practice.
I happen to remember something Mashiro told me yesterday that has me worried.
Namely that Misaki's gonna try hard to get her to spill details about our relationship.
Guess I'll keep my eyes peeled.
【Misaki】
Haaah... Haaah... Go on, Mashiro, tell Uncle Misaki here. How far have you and Masaya gone...?
【Mashiro】
Uh...
【Masaya】
Well, that took no time at all.
【Misaki】
Ouch!
After I bop her lightly on the back of the head, she rubs the spot in pain even though we both know that didn't hurt at all.
【Misaki】
Come on, I was just playing around!
【Masaya】
Seems more like full-blown harassment to me.
【Misaki】
Look, I'm just worried about my little siblings' future. What's wrong with that? I'd hate to see a baby pop out and ruin their dreams.
【Masaya】
I don't remember ever becoming your little brother.
【Misaki】
But it's mostly just plain curiosity! Heehee...
【Masaya】
I think you mean <i>entirely</i> plain curiosity.
【Misaki】
What's your problem? Girls are interested in this kinda stuff too, y'know!
【Misaki】
I am, of course... but so is Mashiro, just so you know.
【Masaya】
Ah!
She looks at me with a mischievous grin. Dammit, that last part about Mashiro made my heart skip a bit.
【Mashiro】
M-Misaki-senpai!
【Misaki】
Hey, I'm a good girl. I don't tell <i>any</i> lies, got it?
【Masaya】
Well, true or not, this is practice time.
【Misaki】
So I can ask about all this stuff outside of practice, then?
The fact that she didn't opt for the obvious "Too bad I'm not in the club, so I don't have to follow your rules!" shows how considerate she is.
【Masaya】
...I'd rather you not, but I can't force your hand.
【Misaki】
Woohoo!
【Mashiro】
Senpaaai!
Mashiro cries out in distress, but I'm just going to have trust her to keep her mouth shut.
Fortunately, we haven't done anything that would... Actually, nevermind. If Misaki found out what we said to each other over the phone last night, I'd want to die.
I just have to bank on Mashiro's resilience. Unfortunately, I can see that crumbling like a cookie with even the slightest pressure from Misaki.
...Now that I think about it, was there <i>really</i> never anything going on between them?
I don't mean a full-blown romantic relationship, but maybe like... trying a few things out of curiosity...?
【Misaki】
Wanna try kissing?
【Mashiro】
I'd be too embarrassed to do that with you, Misaki-senpai... Ah!
...I never took myself as the kind of guy who'd fuss over a girl's past, but damn, the thought of Misaki taking her first kiss really makes me jealous.
Well, I guess there are situations where you'd want to be fussy, but I just personally want to be a more calm and laid-back boyfriend.
【Misaki】
Hehehe! I'm gonna getcha, little girl!
【Mashiro】
Stooop!
【Masaya】
Quit wriggling your fingers.
【Misaki】
Oww... Hey, was that chop harder than last one? I think it was.
【Masaya】
Must be your imagination.
I need to work on my restraint.
【Masaya】
Think you'd be able to play as a Speeder, Misaki?
【Misaki】
I mean, I <i>can,</i> I guess... but not well. What's this about?
【Masaya】
I watched the replay of Mashiro's match against Ichinose, and it's painfully clear that she's lacking matchup experience.
Ichinose showed us everything we need to improve on.
【Misaki】
Oh, right. She's the only Speeder we've got.
Exactly. Our biggest problem right now is our lack of any Speeders beside her.
We could always ask Prez, but he's apparently been busy studying for his university entrance exams, so I'd hate to bother him.
【Masaya】
That lack of raw experience is killing her. We can train all we want, but if she doesn't have experience doing that stuff in actual matches, it won't mean anything.
【Misaki】
Mhm. She either needs to know that matchup like the palm of her hand, or have you give her instructions 0.5 seconds faster.
【Masaya】
Okay, Asuka and I are going to handle Mashiro's anti-Speeder training like we initially planned.
As for where Asuka is, she's currently doing ten laps around the playing field while Madoka times her.
You can do it, Asuka.
【Misaki】
'Kay, then I'm gonna make sure Mashiro's a master in the Fighter matchup!
【Mashiro】
Please do, Misaki-senpai!
【Misaki】
We do have a bit of a problem, though.
【Masaya】
Which is?
【Misaki】
Pretty sure I mentioned it before, but I suck at teaching people. It's <i>such</i> a chore.
【Mashiro】
Then just teach me what things you're good at and what things give you trouble!
【Misaki】
Huh?
【Mashiro】
I'll become the Misaki-senpai counter! That should help out against other Fighters as well.
【Misaki】
Sounds good!
【Mashiro】
And I'll also be able to help you out when you return to the club! It's like killing two birds with one stone!
【Misaki】
......
【Masaya】
......
Both Misaki and I stand there in awkward silence.
Uhhh...
【Misaki】
...I like that.
【Masaya】
What?
【Misaki】
Hm? Well, it's just that determination, you see? Got me feeling purretty jealous. Wish I could have some of that energy you youngsters have.
【Masaya】
I'm not even going to comment on that.
【Misaki】
Aight, Mashiro! I'm going to remodel you into a lean, mean Misaki-chan counter machine!
【Mashiro】
Yaaay!
【Masaya】
Um, no "remodeling," please... whatever that means.
【Misaki】
Here's your first move! I call it the "Ahhh, don't touch Misaki-chan there! Oh no, my head's feeling all fuzzy, I can't think straight anymore! Please, please, no more! I can't handle any more of thiiis!"
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
【Masaya】
That better be something FC-related!
Now that we've decided on what we're going to do, I leave Mashiro with Misaki and head over to Asuka, who's still flying her laps.
【Misaki】
Okay, so let's get to our first order of business.
【Mashiro】
I'm ready!
【Misaki】
Haaah... Haaah... H-Have you and Masaya already kissed...?
【Masaya】
I can't leave you alone for a second.
【Misaki】
Ouch!
【Mashiro】
Wh-What? We haven't kissed. Not even once.
【Masaya】
Just ignore her next time, Mashiro.
Prospects are seeming grim.
It's been about a week since the club learned of our relationship.
It's currently night, and I'm in my room watching a video on how to do maintenance on individual Grav Shoe parts. I look away for a quick second to check my phone.
【Masaya】
...Not today, I guess.
Mashiro and I set a rule that we wouldn't talk beyond 11:00 pm to avoid jacking up our phone bills, so she always calls me around the same time every single day.
But not tonight, for whatever reason.
Tomorrow is going to be our first day without practice since we started dating.
I was going to ask her out on a date over the phone tonight.
I want to make up for last time, when I asked her but she was busy. She emphasized that I really, really, <i>really</i> needed to ask her out again sometime... to the point where she bit her tongue.
【Masaya】
Well, there goes that idea...
Wait, I'm going about this all wrong.
【Masaya】
She deserves a break.
My girlfriend is a real hard worker.
She gives 110% during practice every single day, even practices on her own time in the mornings and evenings, and on top of that, helps out at her family's restaurant.
Incidentally, the reason she turned me down last time was because of that.
Also, I forgot to mention that she calls me to talk every night.
She's probably just too tired to call me tonight. That's understandable.
So, out of consideration for her, I won't call her.
It's a similar thing with her personal practice. If I told her I wanted to come watch, she'd feel pressed by that and think I'm saying she <i>has</i> to do it daily. That's why I don't go.
That sounds kinda bad, though, almost like I don't care about her enough to support her, but I promise I love her! I really, <i>really</i> do! I mean, I'm dying to talk to her on the phone right now!
I want to hear her cute voice. I want her to say "Senpai!" like she always does. I want to see her face, hold her hand... Damn, time out. Call down, Masaya.
Anyway, I do love her and I want to support her in everything she does.
And, like I told her that one night, I'll come flying over anytime if she wants me. I want to be a reliable, supportive boyfriend.
So today I'll settle...
【Masaya】
...A text wouldn't be too much of a bother, right?
I can at least give her some words of encouragement.
【Masaya】
Yeah...
Mashiro's working her tail off, so I have to do the same. Gotta keep going, head held high.
I still have homework to worry about, so I guess I'll start by finishing up the rest of that tomorrow. After that, I'll do some FC simulations, and after that...
【Masaya】
I'm kinda in the mood for some cold udon. Haven't eaten it in a while. Speaking of udon, I heard there was this place with great udon. Mashiro Udon, I think it was called?
【Masaya】
......
Ugh, how cringe. I honestly wanna facepalm at my own stupidity.
【Mashiro】
......
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
You can sit there on your bed as long as you want, Mashiro, but the boy isn't going to call you.
【Mashiro】
Why do you think that?
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
Tell me, then. Has the boy ever once called you instead of the other way around?
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
You can't just assume he will now because you want him to! That's plain unreasonable! Hehehe...
【Mashiro】
...He will, though. I know he will.
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
What makes you say that?
【Mashiro】
...He promised he'd ask me out again. I believe in him.
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
But he's quite the forgetful one, is he not? Have you considered the possibility he may not even have realized there's no practice tomorrow?
【Mashiro】
Well, no...
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
See, this is exactly why you should have said yes the first time. But no, Mashiro, you had to invent some silly reason to turn him down.
【Mashiro】
I didn't invent some reason. I actually had to help out!
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
So what, Mashiro? You could've gone out with him and still made it home in time to help.
【Mashiro】
......
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
Come on, fess up, Mashiro. Your parents didn't raise you to be a liar.
【Mashiro】
I-I wasn't...
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
Weren't what? Go on.
【Mashiro】
My bra and panties didn't match...
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
Haha. You have such a dirty mind, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Ah!
【Mashiro】
I-It's not my fault! I've never had a boyfriend before, so I don't know when and how those things happen!
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
Is that an excuse? There's no way it would happen so early into the relationship. Has our girl read a few too many manga, perhaps?
【Mashiro】
W-Well, what if it <i>did?!</i> I'd be totally down if he wanted to, you know... do some High and Low Yo-Yo on me!
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
...First of all, apologize to the sport of FC for that awful metaphor. And after that, to your parents for telling a lie. Karma will catch up to you.
【Mashiro】
I'm sorry, God of FC. I'm sorry, Mom and Dad. I'm really, <i>really</i> sorry.
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
Well, it might be too late for you now at this point.
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
But, to answer your question... why couldn't you just give him a firm no if he tried something?
【Mashiro】
......
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
Mashiro, I'm talking to you!
【Mashiro】
Oh, shut up.
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
...Well, it's your choice to make. If you're fine with it, I won't complain.
【Mashiro】
I was honestly prepared to wait until the fall tournament for our first date. I feel like he's kind of slow when it comes to romance. Plus, he takes FC <i>super</i> seriously.
【Mashiro】
But he already got my hopes up once, so now I can't help but think way ahead!
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
Just call the boy already.
【Mashiro】
But do guys really want their girlfriend calling them every day of the week?
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
Yes, they do!
【Mashiro】
Well, then why hasn't he called me a single time?
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
Maybe the boy's just concerned for you and wants you getting enough sleep at night? Mashiro... are you really not going to call him?!
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
At the rate this is going, you'll be moping around for a whole month before anything changes.
【Mashiro】
I won't! God, would you just be quiet already?
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
Or... maybe you could come to my world and play some? It's been quite some time since you last logged on. I'm sure you'll have a grand time grinding until sunrise.
【Mashiro】
Is that supposed to sound fun...?
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
Have you forgotten how long you've been a part of--
【Mashiro】
Senpai!
【Mashiro】
Senpai! It's a text! From Senpai! Oh my god!
【Mashiro】
Senpai! It's a text! From Senpai! Oh my god!
【Mashiro】
He probably wants to know if he can call me! Or maybe he's going to ask me out on a date?! Let's see...
【Mashiro】
"Get some rest tomorrow. I'll be doing the same."
【Mashiro】
Wait... <i>what?!</i>
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
That's the sound of your crushed hopes and dreams.
【Mashiro】
Hehe... Hehehehe...
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
It's not too late, Mashiro. You can still boot up your system and join me in my world...
【Mashiro】
I have no other options at this point. I'm going over to his house tomorrow.
【Mashiro】
I'll surprise him and be like, "Hehehe... Look who it is!" acting all cutesy and bashful. It's the perfect plan. I'm totally doing this!
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
Well, I won't stop you.
【Mashiro】
And then, I-I-I-I'll t-take his... h-hand...
【Mashiro】
Okay... I'll <i>hope</i> we get to hold hands...
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
...You're quite the chicken considering those perverse thoughts you were just having not even an hour ago.
【Mashiro】
It's just a small hope. I'm not chickening out!
【Vile God (Mashiro)】
Well, whatever. But, to be honest, I feel like someone is missing...
【Botan】
Did you call for me, Mashiro?
【Mashiro】
Mom, don't barge into my room without knocking! Out! Turn around and get out!
【Botan】
Oh, sounds like someone's in a sour mood. Were you worrying about something related to Hinata-kun again?
【Mashiro】
S-S-S-S-Stop making up random stuff, Mom!
The next day has arrived. Feels like this is my first day without practice or school in a long while.
See, I had a sudden craving for udon, so I walked around town and happened to spot this nice-looking place called "Mashiro Udon" and... Yeah, I should stop with that excuse.
【Masaya】
...God, I hope I don't seem like a stalker.
I'm definitely getting cold feet now that I'm here.
Oh, what's the big deal? I came to my girlfriend's family's restaurant to eat udon. That's it.
As long as I stay calm and adapt as the situation changes, I'll be good.
I want to bother Mashiro and her family as little as possible, which is why I specifically came a few hours after noon, when I know the store won't be very crowded. That's the least I can do.
From what Mashiro's told me, her parents don't know that we're dating yet, so that's one less thing I have to worry about... Well, I wouldn't have come if they did.
I just have to go inside, and then...
【Mashiro】
Welcome to Mashiro Udon! Wait... Senpai!
【Masaya】
Hi.
【Mashiro】
You can have a seat right here.
【Mashiro】
Here's some water for you! So hey, why did you come here?
【Masaya】
I just felt like getting some udon, you know?
【Mashiro】
You're so silly...
【Mashiro】
Here's your cold tempura udon, sir! By the way, Senpai, it's the special Mashiro version. I made it just for you.
Yeah, very likely...
She doesn't even make the udon, her dad does. So if I got a special Mashiro version, well... I don't think I'd want to eat that.
Hm, maybe she'll be the typical clumsy waitress...
【Mashiro】
Here you are, the Mashiro Udon Special Hellfire Udon-- Oh no no no no!
【Masaya】
OWWWWWWWWW!
Please no. I don't want to die.
Also, I feel like that was slightly insulting to my girlfriend in a few ways. I'm sorry, Mashiro.
【Masaya】
Okay, let's do this.
Following those completely pointless visions, I walk inside.
【Botan】
Two zaru udons and one tempura udon, here you are. Oh, you want to place another order? Of course.
【Botan】
Would you like another glass of water? Yes? Okay, I'll be right back with that. I'll head to the register soon, everyone, don't worry!
【Botan】
The Hellfire Udon is ready? Okay. I'm so sorry about that wait. What would you like to have?
【Masaya】
......
This is chaos.
Wait, why is it this packed? I was sure there wouldn't be this many people past one...
【Botan】
Welcome to Mashiro Udon! Oh, look who it is. Why hello there, Hinata-kun.
It didn't take long for Mashiro's mom to spot me.
【Botan】
If you're here to see Mashiro, she isn't home right now.
...The fact that she immediately assumes I'm here to see Mashiro is throwing me for a loop. I can't talk for a brief moment.
Hm?
【Masaya】
Mashiro's gone? The place looks <i>really</i> packed, though.
【Botan】
She mentioned there wasn't any practice today, so I let her quit after noon. She left the house not long after. My guess was that she had a date, but now I'm not so sure...
She almost seems to be implying that this "date" she had in mind was with me...
【Masaya】
Uh, I wouldn't know.
I don't mean "we didn't plan a date today," but rather, "I have no idea what you're talking about."
Mashiro assured me her parents still don't know, so I'm going to play along...
【Botan】
Oh, that's strange. Where is she, then?
Are you sure they don't know, Mashiro?! Are you <i>really</i> sure?!
【Botan】
Well, it's still quite rare for the place to be full at this time of day. It was almost empty not even an hour or so ago, but everyone just rushed in at once.
【Botan】
Hehe... I'm in quite the predicament without my dear little Mashiro here to help me.
I imagine she really does have her hands full at the moment, but she seems to be handling it with ease.
I still don't know her too well, but she seems to be a very kind-hearted lady.
【Botan】
Coming! Sorry, I have to go to a table. Would you like to stay and have something, Hinata-kun?
【Masaya】
Oh, no. I'll--
The place is already super packed, and Mashiro isn't even here, so I'll probably just come back and have some udon on a different day. I'm just about to tell her that, when...
【Botan】
Ah...
Mashiro's mom suddenly lets out a small gasp, like she just thought of something.
【Botan】
Do you have any plans for the day, Hinata-kun?
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Botan】
I could <i>really</i> use some help right now.
【Botan】
Pretty please?
【Masaya】
Sure...
Well, I can basically see where this is going.
【Mashiro】
...Okay.
【Mashiro】
I've been standing around here long enough. I need to press it now before I pass out from this heat.
【Mashiro】
You've got this, Mashiro. Anybody can ring a doorbell. That's easy stuff.
【Mashiro】
Oh, but what if he opens the door and gives me that "What are you doing here?" face...?
【Mashiro】
Nonsense. Come on, Mashiro. You know he would never do that.
【Mashiro】
Yeah, you're right! Thanks, Mashiro!
【Mashiro】
...Everything's golden. I'm definitely not having a panic attack right now. I'm just getting a little dizzy from all the thinking.
【Mashiro】
Deep breaths. Haaah...
【Mashiro】
I've practiced this a million times in front of the mirror. Just gotta...
【Mashiro】
Hehehe! Guess who!
【Mashiro】
Perfect! Should be perfect... I hope.
【Mashiro】
Let's do this!
【Mashiro】
...Okay, how about when the next minute starts.
【Mashiro】
39, 40, 41, 42... Wait, time out.
【Mashiro】
What if I ring the doorbell and his mom answers the door?!
【Mashiro】
Standing outside their house for as long as I have been is probably not a good idea, so let's go somewhere else for a moment...
【Mashiro】
Okay! I've got a plan down pat in the event that his mom or someone else from his family comes out.
【Mashiro】
Sweat wiped off, applied antiperspirants, nothing wrong with my appearance. I'm good to go.
【Mashiro】
Please watch over me, Senpai...!
【Mashiro】
Time to head meowt...!
【Mashiro】
......
【Mashiro】
.........
【Mashiro】
............
【Mashiro】
...............
【Mashiro】
Sooo...
【Mashiro】
......
【Mashiro】
.........
【Mashiro】
This isn't what I think it is, is it?
【Mashiro】
Are you kidding...? I struggled so hard to come up with plans for everything, since I have no real reason for coming here, and it was all for nothing!
【Rika】
I don't think anyone's home.
【Mashiro】
Ugh!
【Rika】
They're all out at the moment... Wait, Arisaka-san? Is that you?
【Mashiro】
Hi, Ichinose-san... Oh, right! I guess you're next door neighbors.
【Rika】
Are you here to see Hinata-san and... Oh, I see...
【Mashiro】
Stop jumping to conclusions!
【Rika】
Hehe... Don't worry, it's not anything about you spending the night.
【Mashiro】
...You still remember that?
【Mashiro】
For the last time, I'm not here to...
【Rika】
Huh? You didn't come to see Hinata-san?
【Mashiro】
No no, that wasn't what I-- Ah!
【Rika】
Ah?
【Mashiro】
Hey, Ichinose-san! Are you doing anything today?
【Rika】
Not particularly... I don't have practice today.
【Mashiro】
Perfect! Same as our... Ahem, I knew you wouldn't. I actually came here to see you!
【Rika】
Were you about to say something else?
【Mashiro】
No, that's just your imagination.
【Rika】
You know you're standing in front of Hinata-san's house, right? It even says so on the nameplate.
【Mashiro】
Um, sooo... Oh, yeah! I wanted him to introduce me to you, since he knows you better than me.
【Mashiro】
But he's not home right now, and we already found each other, so that doesn't matter anymore.
【Rika】
Uh, okay... So why did you come here to see me, then?
【Mashiro】
Just give me one second... Oh, right! We faced each other during the practice session the other day, remember? I was thinking, like, maybe we could go over it together and you could give me some tips.
【Rika】
Sure, that sounds great. Would you like to come to my room?
【Mashiro】
Sure!
【Mashiro】
Um... Hopefully I managed to fool her? I think I did, at least.
【Rika】
Here's some cold barley tea.
【Mashiro】
......
【Rika】
I also brought some sweets I made myself. Help yourself if you'd... Arisaka-san? Is everything okay?
【Rika】
Is there something out there? Oh, I know Hinata-san isn't home at the moment, but peeking inside his room would be a little rude.
【Mashiro】
You're so lucky...
【Rika】
Pardon?
【Mashiro】
Oh, nothing, just talking to myself... So, what are we doing again?
【Rika】
You already forgot the reason you came here...?
【Mashiro】
No, I didn't mean it like that... Oh, right, right! I wanted to go over the details of our match together!
【Rika】
Based on statistics and overall match results, Fighter is said to be the best playstyle at the highest level of FC. Did you know that?
【Mashiro】
Um... I think I heard it mentioned before.
【Rika】
This really shows at Takafuji. We have many students who wish to become professional Skywalkers, so the number of people wanting to be Fighters dwarfs any other role, even despite our best efforts to keep numbers balanced.
【Rika】
We've always been relatively short on Speeders... but now it's getting to the point where I have difficulty getting practice in against anyone not a Fighter.
【Mashiro】
Me too...
【Rika】
Huh?
【Mashiro】
I totally get that, Ichinose-san! I'm the only Speeder in our club right now!
【Rika】
You switched, didn't you? I remembered you being a Fighter back during our Golden Week practice, so I was really surprised to learn you were a Speeder now.
【Mashiro】
It's time for Speeders to rise up and show the world what we're made of! Actually, we'll do it! You and me will show them, Ichinose-san!
【Rika】
Um, is that some pent-up frustration leaking?
【Mashiro】
No, I just tried cracking a little joke. But yeah, I really, <i>really</i> know how you feel!
【Rika】
I see. Hehe...
【Rika】
Then, if you don't mind me saying something...
【Mashiro】
The floor is all yours.
【Rika】
Let's stay devoted, pure Speeders forever, Arisaka-san!
【Mashiro】
I can't. Like you mentioned, I was already a Fighter once.
【Rika】
Arisaka-saaan?! I meant, from <i>now on,</i> okay?!
【Mashiro】
Haha, sorry.
【Rika】
You're so silly.
【Rika】
Hehe...
【Mashiro】
Hahaha. That was kind of funny.
【Rika】
Yeah. You can be really mischievous at times.
【Mashiro】
Wow, rude! Hehe...
【Rika】
This reminds me of what you said to me during our match.
【Mashiro】
What did I say? Sorry, you have to remind me.
【Rika】
"You know, we probably would've been really good friends if we met under different circumstances."
【Mashiro】
Oh, yeah. I <i>did</i> say that.
【Rika】
And right after that, you tried attacking while I was responding, and when I narrowly managed to dodge, you even said "almost had her."
【Mashiro】
No, that has to be some sort of mistake. I definitely never did anything like that.
【Rika】
Hehe... That's just how you are.
【Mashiro】
Hold up! Given what I just said, you're implying I'm a bad person!
【Rika】
It's fine. I like that about you.
【Mashiro】
...That sweet little smile and tilt of the head was pretty convincing. I can totally see you using that to make any guy you want do your bidding.
【Rika】
What are you trying to say about me?!
【Mashiro】
Hahaha... Don't worry, I meant that as a compliment.
【Rika】
That's not a compliment, no matter how you spin it!
【Rika】
...Well, you're a fellow member of the Speeders Alliance, so I'll make an exception this time and forgive you.
【Mashiro】
What? When did I ever join that weird alliance?
【Rika】
Hehehe... You know, it really is a shame we don't live closer. If we did, we might still be able to practice with each other even though we go to different schools.
【Mashiro】
Yeah, that'd be cool. I'd love to practice with you sometime. And if I came over again, that'd mean I'd get to try some of your delicious sweets... again...!
【Rika】
Hm? What's out there...? Did Hinata-san come back?
【Mashiro】
...That works.
【Rika】
What works?
【Mashiro】
I'm coming over again! We can practice together whenever you want!
【Rika】
Wait, <i>seriously?</i> But I'd feel so bad making you come all the way out here all the time. We could maybe take turns and--
【Mashiro】
Oh no, I don't mind at all! I want a reason to come here every day. Plus, I desperately need practice against another Speeder.
【Rika】
Um, I'm not sure all of those made sense to me.
【Mashiro】
...Oh, but I'm sure you'll have plans on certain days, so I won't come if you're busy or just don't want me to. That work?
【Rika】
Well, to be honest, I have no reason to say no.
【Rika】
Both of my parents work late into the evenings, so having you around would make things a lot more fun for me.
【Rika】
Oh, but don't misunderstand. It's not like I get terribly lonely being home alone.
【Mashiro】
...Can I really?
【Rika】
Of course you can! I guess this marks the birth of the Speeder Alliance, huh?
【Mashiro】
And I'm back. Phew...
【Mashiro】
I wonder where Senpai went. He never did come back before I left.
【Mashiro】
No, that doesn't matter. I have tomorrow to look forward to... He'll be all like:
【Mashiro】
Huh? Is that my cute girlfriend Mashiro I see?! Whatever are you doing in Ichinose's room?
【Mashiro】
Yeah! We're going to be practicing together to help each other improve! Isn't that cool?!
【Mashiro】
What, really?! God, I love you so much, my sweet little angel! It's already late out, so go ahead and sleep in my room with me tonight!
【Mashiro】
Ahhhhhh!
【Mashiro】
Wait, hold up. My motivations are <i>definitely</i> not that impure. Though, if I work hard enough, that kind of reward might be waiting for me.
【Mashiro】
...Okay, I'm going to give this all I've got, then cash in that reward.
【Mashiro】
But yeah, I can't wait to see the look on Senpai's face when he sees me at Ichinose-san's place tomorrow. Hehe...
【Mashiro】
He isn't going to get mad at me for not consulting him first, right? I really hope he'll give me his support...
【Mashiro】
But really, where was he today?
【Mashiro】
...He didn't go visit some other girl, did he? Yeah, right. My boyfriend would never do that.
【Mashiro】
Then why do I have this weird feeling that something's wrong...? Ugh, I can't calm down.
【Mashiro】
I trust him, I really, <i>really</i> do, but... I guess I'll text him once I get to my room.
【Mashiro】
I'm home!
【Masaya】
Welcome to Mashiro Udon!
I hear Mashiro's voice loud and clear in the now-empty restaurant.
I don't know where she went, but she's back. About time.
【Masaya】
Hey, Mashiro...san.
【Masaya】
Hey, Mashiro..
...san.
I made the mistake of referring to her as just "Mashiro" earlier, which earned me a death glare from the kitchen, so I attached an honorific after a slight delay.
It makes no sense. I called her Mashiro the one time I came here before we started dating. Did her dad just forget...?
【Mashiro】
......
【Masaya】
...Mashiro? San?
【Mashiro】
...What?
【Masaya】
Earth to Mashirooo? Saaan?
I don't know if she's just shocked or seriously in disbelief, but she's not moving. I try calling out to her and waving my eyes around to break her out of this spell.
Also, I keep forgetting this honorific every time.
【Mashiro】
Um, why are you...?
Dumbfounded, she mutters to herself. Seems she still hasn't grasped the situation.
Hm, what to say...?
【Masaya】
Thought I'd come pay you a visit.
【Mashiro】
Why are you the one saying that?!
【Masaya】
Um, I just thought I'd lighten the mood some. Wait, was that really something worth getting so upset over?
【Mashiro】
Yes! You stole my line! I was supposed to say that to you!
【Masaya】
You're really confusing me here!
【Botan】
Oh, is that you, Mashiro? Finally home?
【Mashiro】
Mom, explain this!
【Masaya】
Mashiro's... I mean Mashiro-san's mom!
【Botan】
Botan-san.
【Masaya】
...Sorry, Botan-san.
For the record, she's the one who insisted I call her that... rather forcibly, at that.
It's a bit embarrassing to call a woman her age by her first name, but as an employee, I have to respect my employer's wishes.
【Mashiro】
What's going on here, Mom?! Tell me why he's wearing the store's apron!
【Botan】
Do you not remember when I mentioned that I was looking to hire someone to help during our rush hours?
【Botan】
Anyway, since you weren't around and the store was a little too busy for me to handle alone, I sweet-talked him into helping me.
【Mashiro】
Sweet-talked...?!
【Mashiro】
That bad feeling I had...
【Botan】
I took a liking to him, so I went ahead and hired him as a part-time worker. His name is Masaya Hinata. He goes to the same school as you, and even seems to be in the same club as you, Mashiro. How wonderful is that?
【Masaya】
My name is Masaya Hinata. I look forward to working with you from now on.
I need to act proper, since this is a job and all, so I bow my head and give a formal introduction.
【Mashiro】
Moooooom!
Mashiro, on the other hand, doesn't seem too pleased by this. She raises her voice in protest.
【Botan】
Look, dear, I didn't force him. Some things happened, I offered him the job politely, and he said yes.
【Mashiro】
Senpai?!
【Masaya】
...Sorry I did this without asking you.
I lower my voice, mainly so it won't reach the kitchen, and apologize.
【Masaya】
I just wanted to see you working hard up close.
【Masaya】
Well, more so that I just want to be with you more in general, but that's a sappy way of putting it.
【Mashiro】
I feel the same way myself, Senpai... That's why I joined the Speeder Alliance... But now everything's just...
【Masaya】
I'll be showing up here for work, so we'll be able to spend at least a bit more of our time together, Mashiro.
I tell her my honest thoughts and feelings.
And I have confidence she'll understand that.
【Masaya】
So would you be willing to approve of this... pretty please?
【Mashiro】
Ugh! God, why did this have to happen!
【Masaya】
Wait, what?! What's wrong, Mashiro?! San?!
She falls to the ground, distraught, and I quickly move over and take hold of her hand.
After that, she told me the sad, sad story of a certain couple whose wish to spend more time with each other backfired spectacularly...
...Oh, actually, I just realized something.
It may've been a spur of the moment kind of thing, but I think this is the first time we've held hands as a couple.
After practice.
【Masaya】
Okay. Think I'm gonna head out.
I get up and grab my bag.
【Asuka】
Oh, Masaya-san! Would you like to go home toge-- Ah!
【Asuka】
I-I'm sorry, Mashiro-chan! I'm just so used to it... It wasn't on purpose, I promise!
【Mashiro】
You don't have to worry about that, Asuka-senpai. I don't mind.
【Misaki】
<i>Sure</i> you don't. Keep telling yourself that.
【Mashiro】
M-Misaki-senpai!
【Madoka】
Hey, want to go home with me today, Hinata-kun? What do you say?
【Masaya】
Why would I <i>ever</i> do that?
【Asuka】
Why would he do that?
【Misaki】
Yeah, literally why?
【Mashiro】
Why would he go home with <i>you!</i>
【Madoka】
Wh-Why am I being bullied by everyone at once!
【Masaya】
Oh, now that we're on the subject, though. Asuka, could you go home with Mashiro for me?
【Asuka】
What? Oh, I understand. Mashiro-chan's going to be coming over to your house later?
【Misaki】
Heh... Do I smell the scent of debauchery in the air?
【Masaya】
You're delusional. But back to what I was saying, we should go home together, Misaki.
【Misaki】
Huh? Wait, slow down. I'm the one you wanna spend some <i>quality</i> time with?
【Masaya】
No, get your mind out of the gutter. I just have to go to Mashiro's place today, and she has to go to Ichinose's.
【Misaki】
...Why're you acting like I understand that? It makes no sense.
【Madoka】
Kiss each other and make up already, you two!
【Masaya】
Just stop, Madoka.
I give her a light chop on the head.
【Madoka】
Oww!
【Masaya】
Me and Mashiro aren't fighting or anything. It's a little hard to explain...
【Asuka】
What happened?
【Mashiro】
Something, um, beyond stupid happened and we're both still cursing ourselves for it...
The odd thing is, though, we actually manage to see each other more during the day now as a result.
【Mashiro】
Haaah... Haaah... Haaah... Haaah...
【Rika】
Are you okay? Do you want to take a quick break?
【Mashiro】
T-Tell me, Ichinose-san...
【Rika】
Yeah?
【Mashiro】
You were going easy on me during our match, weren't you? I'm convinced of it.
【Rika】
No way. I'm nowhere near good enough to sandbag in a match and hide it from everyone.
【Mashiro】
Ugh, this makes no sense! Why?! I could've sworn I wasn't that far behind you in terms of skill...
【Rika】
Do you want my honest opinion?
【Mashiro】
Yeah, I do.
【Rika】
It feels to me like you aren't <i>really</i> trying.
【Rika】
During our match, you were a <i>lot</i> more focused and determined. It was almost like your burning desire to win was taking your body beyond its normal physical limits.
【Mashiro】
Well, that's because my confession was on the line...
【Rika】
How would I describe it? It was almost like a strong passion, or desire, or even some sort of grudge or resentment.
【Mashiro】
It was just the power of love...
【Rika】
What did you say? I didn't quite catch that.
【Mashiro】
...If I manage to clutch it out over you in our next match, I want you to let me call you master.
【Rika】
Oh, that's a little embarrassing. I'm not <i>that</i> much better than you... Wait, you want to call me that if <i>you</i> win?
【Mashiro】
Master as in master of trickery and deceit.
【Rika】
Well, for starters, you only address someone as master if you respect them, and I feel like you're kind of slandering me with those comments...
【Mashiro】
What do you have to worry about? I'm so bad I look like I'm not even trying when I am. You'd have to be sleeping to lose to me, am I right?
【Rika】
Yeah, I guess that comment really offended you...
【Mashiro】
Well, you'd better be prepared, because I'll show up even stronger to our next match!
【Rika】
...I admire the confidence, but personally, I'd rather we keep things more friendly.
【Rika】
I'll accept your challenge, but with a condition of my own. If I win, you have to start calling me Rika.
【Rika】
And I will call you Mashironi!
【Mashiro】
God, that sounds just like macaroni... <i>You're</i> clearly the one who's still upset, Ichinose-san.
【Rika】
Let's do this...
【Mashiro】
Bring it...!
【Rika】
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
【Mashiro】
Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
【Mashiro】
I hate everything!
【Masaya】
Uh, okay.
So basically, she lost.
【Mashiro】
I was so, <i>so</i> close, too! That was the closest I've ever gotten to beating her.
【Masaya】
Um, there are still people eating, so try to keep it down, okay?
【Mashiro】
Don't believe Rika's lies, Senpai. She seems like a perfectly nice girl on the surface, but let your guard down, and she'll stab you in the back. I bet she does that even outside of FC.
【Masaya】
...You and her have gotten pretty close, huh?
【Mashiro】
Hm? I never thought about that, but I guess we have, considering we're practicing together and stuff. I have a lot of fun with her.
【Masaya】
Glad to hear.
【Mashiro】
I'm going to start calling her "Snake" tomorrow! See how she likes that!
【Masaya】
......
She's certainly fired up, but I don't know if that's a good thing, seeing how she's treating poor Ichinose...
【Mashiro】
So yeah, I was going to ask you about this move she pulled on me today.
【Masaya】
Later, Mashiro. I'm still on the clock.
【Mashiro】
Who cares? Nobody's going to come through the door this late anyway.
【Masaya】
You don't know that, Mashiro... I mean, Mashiro-san.
【Mashiro】
It feels really weird when you call me that.
【Masaya】
Hey, don't say that. We don't want him to know I call you Mashiro when I'm not here.
At this point, the best option is probably just to avoid using her name.
【Mashiro】
Trying to save your own skin, huh? I get it. Let's just hope you can win him over one of these days.
【Masaya】
Quiet, Mashironi.
【Mashiro】
Senpaaai?
【Masaya】
Yes?
【Mashiro】
Do you want to see me get angry? You won't like me when I'm angry!
【Masaya】
Sorry.
I recall the old idiom between the devil and the deep blue sea.
【Mashiro】
What'll I do if Mom hears you calling me that...
【Botan】
Masaya-kun.
【Mashiro】
Ah!
【Masaya】
Yes, Botan-san?
【Botan】
You can go ahead and clock out for the day.
【Masaya】
Huh? But my shift isn't over.
【Botan】
Right, I have something I'd like you to do.
She claps her hands together like she just thought of the perfect idea.
【Botan】
Could I ask you to help Mashiro study for the rest of your shift?
【Mashiro】
What?!
【Masaya】
You want me to help her study?
【Botan】
Well, I suppose that isn't the right word. I want you to help her do her summer homework. It's already the middle of August, and I have a feeling she hasn't completed it yet.
【Mashiro】
W-Well...
A very evident no.
【Botan】
Can you do that for me?
【Masaya】
This'll be the hardest task I've had to do at Mashiro Udon...
【Mashiro】
You're swallowing your saliva?!
【Masaya】
I mean, you routinely fail midterms and finals, right?
Her lack of academic prowess was evident when I had to help her study for her make-up tests.
【Botan】
Pretty please?
【Masaya】
I'll do it.
【Mashiro】
Ugh, I'm sorry to have to trouble you like this...
She simply resigns herself to her fate.
Which means she probably needs a lot of help.
【Botan】
Okay, head on up to her room and help her there.
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
Right then, I realize the problem that me being left alone with her in her room would create.
Well, her parents are here... so I doubt things will go in that direction.
【Mashiro】
......
My girlfriend seems to have other ideas, though!
【Mashiro】
......
Stop that, dammit. Don't wink at me! Your mom's going to see.
【Botan】
Then again, her room is beyond messy, so that's probably unwise. How about you do it down here for today, and next time she'll have her room cleaned for you?
【Masaya】
Fine by me.
【Mashiro】
Phew...
I've been saved. Well, probably more Mashiro than me.
I mean, going to her room isn't a big deal, but it just came out of nowhere, so it caught me off-guard.
【Botan】
Okay, you can use the big table there in the back.
【Masaya】
Thanks.
【Mashiro】
Tell me, Mom...
【Botan】
Yes?
【Mashiro】
Are you messing with me for fun?
【Botan】
What could you possibly be talking about, dear? I'm always on your side.
【Mashiro】
Right... Thanks.
【Botan】
Come tell me if you get hungry while studying, okay? I'll give you some delicious udon specially made with "mashironi" noodles.
【Mashiro】
Mom?!
【Botan】
Hehe.
【Masaya】
......
It's not the first time I've had this thought, but yeah...
Botan-san is the last person I'd want to make an enemy out of...
Occasionally we have days like today, where I'm off work, but Mashiro and Ichinose meet up for their Speeder Alliance training.
【Mashiro】
S-Slow down!
【Masaya】
Oh.
They're still practicing? Man, it's pretty late.
I've been reviewing standard FC moves and strategies for the past while, but I put that on pause, get up off my chair, and open the window.
【Mashiro】
Huh? What was that weird thing you did just now? Wait, I swear I've seen it before... Um...
【Rika】
Shindou-senpai and Asuka-san used it at the tournament.
【Mashiro】
Yeah, the Airkick Turn...!
【Rika】
I just recently mastered it.
【Mashiro】
T-Teach me! How do you do it?! Is it easy?!
【Rika】
It's pretty difficult until you get the hang of it, but I'm sure you'll get there with enough practice, PW.
【Mashiro】
You're still going with that nickname...
【Rika】
Why, of course! Following my victory just now, I'll give you your 20th nickname. Congratulations, PW!
【Mashiro】
...I don't even feel like asking, but what does PW stand for?
【Rika】
What? Pure white, of course. I thought that was obvious.
【Mashiro】
Obvious my butt... Who would even think of translating a person's name to English, then abbreviating it...
【Masaya】
Looks like they're having fun out there.
They're too far away for me to hear, but I can tell they're having a heated discussion.
Probably something about techniques or move strings.
I've made a point to not attend any of the Speeder Alliance's practice sessions, nor tell them what they should or should not do.
They don't want me to.
Everything I have to teach Mashiro, I do during practice.
There's a lot of benefits to having Skywalkers think for themselves, exchange opinions with other players, and learn through repeated trial and error. This should stimulate their growth.
It might be one of those things you can only do when you're young and an amateur. Watching them is heartwarming.
【Rika】
Hey, Hinata-san!
【Masaya】
Oh?
On occassion, I will join them and share my thoughts, though. But only when they request me.
Ichinose's always the one who comes to get me, so maybe Mashiro feels too embarrassed?
【Rika】
Are you doing anything right now?
【Masaya】
No, I'm good. I'll be up there in a moment. But don't forget that flying's banned around these parts, so be a little quieter.
【Masaya】
So, what's the problem? Split opinion on what works best after a certain move?
【Mashiro】
Get this.
【Masaya】
I'm listening.
【Rika】
Mashiro totally feels like a PW, doesn't she? Tell her, Hinata-san!
【Mashiro】
She totally sucks at coming up with nicknames, Senpai! Help me!
【Masaya】
What the hell were you guys even talking about before I came out here?!
【Mashiro】
Ah?!
Misaki's feints are tricky. She forces her opponent to think she'll do one thing by using smart, non-committal movements, then capitalizes on those expectations. Your body reacts even though you know her gameplan.
That's exactly what happened here. She did a wind-up motion, utilizing both her joints and muscles, baited Mashiro into thinking she was going to move right, and punished her for reacting.
That's what makes her feints so fearsome. You fall for them even though you know not to.
Not even a second after the feint, Misaki is already in Mashiro's blind spot.
Mashiro, having lost sight of her opponent, meanders aimlessly through the air as Misaki assumes position behind her back.
【Misaki】
Hehehe! Gotcha again... And there!
Misaki swiftly swipes at Mashiro's back.
【Mashiro】
Ahhhhhh...!
But before her hand can make contact...
【Mashiro】
Ahhh!
Mashiro successfully evades her attack with a maneuver I've never seen from her before.
【Misaki】
Huh...?
【Madoka】
Whoa, what a dodge! I thought she fell right for Misaki's feint.
【Asuka】
That was amazing, Mashiro-chan!
【Mashiro】
Haaah... Haaah... Haaah... Did I... pull it off...?
【Misaki】
Hey... What the hell'd you just do?
【Mashiro】
Oh, um...
【Mashiro】
Th-They call it the Airkick Turn! I'm sure you've heard of it!
【Misaki】
Yeah, that's the move we saw in Asuka and Shindou-san's match.
【Mashiro】
Oh, that's right...
【Misaki】
I was more asking how you managed to pull that off. I've never seen you do anything like that before.
【Mashiro】
Well, um, it was entirely luck...
【Asuka】
But your flying has really changed a lot lately! It feels a lot more efficient... or sharper?
【Mashiro】
Wow, really? That's <i>super</i> reassuring coming from you!
【Madoka】
Yeah, Misaki would never compliment you like that.
【Misaki】
Why you little...
【Misaki】
Ah...!
...Um, I'm not sure why you're glaring at me, Misaki.
【Mashiro】
Heheheheheh! It was only a matter of time. All babies eventually learn to walk. Same principle.
【Madoka】
Wow, she's already acting all smug!
【Asuka】
She's being really straightforward.
【Misaki】
Oh, I see. Maybe it's time for me to start calling you Mashiro-san to give you the respect you deserve.
【Mashiro】
No, at this point, I'm sick and tired of nicknames and all that... Also, Misaki-senpai, I promise I'm not full of myself. I was just kidding.
【Misaki】
And if you manage to perfect my eye-and-body feint, you might even level up to Mashiro-sama!
【Mashiro】
Thanks! I'll pass on the Mashiro-sama thing, but I'll try my best! Let's go, Misaki-senpai!
【Misaki】
I'll no longer think of you as my friend Mashiro...
【Mashiro】
What? Um... Misaki-senpai?
【Misaki】
I'm cranking up Misaki-chan's difficulty setting from easy to medium!
【Mashiro】
What kind of setting is-- Whoa?!
【Misaki】
Take thiiiiiis! Better get ready, Mashiro, 'cause there's more where that came from!
【Mashiro】
N-Nooo...! Don't touch me so forcefully, Misaki-senpai!
【Asuka】
It looks like they're having tons of fun out there.
【Madoka】
Uh, I don't know about that... Seems more like a lion trying to chase its prey to me.
【Masaya】
Oh, so you weren't able to pull off any more Airkick Turns after that one?
【Mashiro】
No... I tried getting Rika to teach me again after practice, but nothing. It was pure luck the first time. I can't imagine I'll be able to do another one for a while.
【Masaya】
Sounds like you think you'll get the hang of it eventually, though.
【Mashiro】
Yeah, I'm <i>definitely</i> going to master it someday!
【Masaya】
...I like the sound of that.
【Mashiro】
Uh, what?
【Masaya】
You're so positive, and I think that's great.
【Mashiro】
Pfft!
【Masaya】
Whoa, don't spit everywhere. Are you okay?
【Mashiro】
D-Don't hit me with those surprise attacks, Senpai. God, you really startled me... I think I almost got a nosebleed.
【Masaya】
That makes no sense...
【Mashiro】
You know, I've had this feeling for a while now...
【Masaya】
Hm?
【Mashiro】
A lot of good stuff's been happening in my life lately.
【Mashiro】
I'm getting better at FC, everyone talks about how good I'm doing, and I even got to know Rika a little better.
【Masaya】
You've been working hard, Mashiro. That's why.
Knowing that she's happy puts a smile on my face.
【Mashiro】
And best of all, I now have an amazing boyfriend who works at my family's restaurant, helps me study, and even takes time out of his day to help me during my personal practice sessions...
【Masaya】
I'm not taking time out of anything. I do all that because I want to.
【Mashiro】
Then you also whisper "I love you, Mashiro." when we're on the phone together.
【Masaya】
...Hey.
【Mashiro】
Let's hear it!
【Masaya】
I'm not saying that now, silly.
【Mashiro】
Hehehe... I guess I'm being a little selfish.
【Masaya】
Ah...!
【Mashiro】
Oh, you're not going to say it, are you?
【Masaya】
...So you were trying to trick me into saying it with that little sad voice you used?
【Mashiro】
Well, you didn't say anything for a second after, so you <i>did</i> consider it, right?
【Masaya】
Haha. You're a clever girl.
【Mashiro】
Hehehe!
【Masaya】
You're never gonna hear that again, Mashiro. You've made too many mistakes.
【Mashiro】
Wooow! Come on, Senpai, pleaaase?
God, she's just so adorable.
Now I have the urge to fluster <i>her</i> a little bit.
【Masaya】
Oh, yeah. Speaking of I love yous.
【Mashiro】
Try saying that again, but whisper it and put more heart into it.
【Masaya】
So, I was organizing my old text messages the other day, yeah?
【Mashiro】
Okay.
【Masaya】
Remember that time you and Asuka went swimming? It was before we started going out. Anyway, you saw me and sent a text.
【Mashiro】
Wait... are you talking about <i>that</i> text?
【Masaya】
If you take the first word from each sentence, top to bottom, it reads "Think I like you." Isn't that crazy? I couldn't stop laughing when I noticed. You can check for yourself.
【Mashiro】
Hmph!
【Masaya】
Man, talk about a Freudian slip. It must've been destiny that you fell in love with me.
I tease her to my heart's content.
【Mashiro】
...Y-You figured that out <i>way</i> too late.
【Masaya】
Guess so.
【Mashiro】
You really are dense...
【Masaya】
Wait... No way. Don't tell me that was on purpose...?
【Mashiro】
Ngh!
【Masaya】
Hold up! Why?! Did you really think I'd catch something that random?!
【Mashiro】
Ahhh, I'm done! This conversation is over! The expiration date's passed on that!
【Masaya】
Man, that's a shame.
I really messed up big time back then.
She should've known better than to give me a riddle like that, but still, I definitely can't tease her now after hearing the truth. I'd feel bad.
But what do I talk about now? I can't hit her with an "I love you" out of nowhere...
【Mashiro】
Huh? Wait one second.
【Masaya】
What's up?
【Mashiro】
Why were you reorganizing your text messages?
【Masaya】
Well, you know...
Oh crap.
【Mashiro】
Let me take a guess... You put all the texts from your cute little girlfriend into a new folder just for her?
【Masaya】
I'm hanging up. Don't look for me. I'm going on a long journey.
【Mashiro】
Calm down, Senpai. Look, I did the exact same thing. It's no big deal.
【Masaya】
It's cute when a girl does it, but when a guy does it, it just feels creepy...
I promise I'm not some creep. I just got a little too giddy and lost track of time after I started doing it.
Maybe I was tired, or maybe I was possessed by something... Either way, I'm not usually like that, I swear!
【Mashiro】
Well I think it's adorable, Senpai.
【Masaya】
Well, sure, but having someone discover it and being forced to tell them just feels, you know...
【Mashiro】
It's embarrassing, right?
【Masaya】
Just kill me now.
【Mashiro】
Fine, I'll give you a little bit of relief.
【Mashiro】
I'll do something super embarrassing that'll make me want to die too. That way, we'll be even.
【Masaya】
Don't do it, Mashiro. Live on without me.
【Mashiro】
I have to do it. Hearing what you did with my texts put me in a real good mood.
【Mashiro】
Just... try not to think of me as a weirdo for this.
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Mashiro】
......
【Masaya】
Mashiro...? You still there?
【Mashiro】
Mmmph...
【Masaya】
Ah!
【Mashiro】
G-Good night, Senpai!
【Masaya】
......
The screen reads call ended.
But the soft sound of Mashiro's kiss still lingers in my mind.
...Actually, that's the first time she's hung up instead of the other way around.
I turn my phone on again and find a certain text message.
Sender: Mashiro Arisaka\\nSubject: Senpai\\nThink again, perv.
I think that was really nice\\nLike that you helped us\\nYou should let me thank
...I mean, sure, this text is super stilted and unnatural.
【Masaya】
But who the hell would spot that hidden message?
Even though I see it now, it still seems far too hard.
It might've been more noticeable if we were already dating, but we weren't back then.
【Masaya】
Guess I can still appreciate that she sent it to me, though.
I voice a thank you to her in my head, then compose a text to Mashiro and write "I love you."
【Masaya】
......
I quickly delete it, then go to my calendar.
We're already about halfway through August.
Next month is September. The fall tournament is on the 24th.
That's fine. Both Mashiro and Asuka have been making great progress, so I know they'll be ready.
But there's something else that saddens me...
【Masaya】
So long, summer break...
【Masaya】
...I didn't get to do much besides practicing.
After that, I hop onto my computer and find a page listing all the summer events in the local region.
...Go figure. They're all done.
【Masaya】
...I just wish I could've done <i>something</i> with her.
It kind of slipped my mind, since we've been so busy lately and all, but we haven't actually gone on a proper date yet.
【Masaya】
Hm...
【Masaya】
It's so hard because we're never free the same days.
I have work.
And Mashiro has her Speeder Alliance stuff with Ichinose. Plus, she's also helping out at their restaurant on days like today.
True to the old saying make hay while the sun shines, I made my way over here the very next day, but whether I ask her or not depends on how things play out.
If it's busy and they need help, I might do that... Actually, her dad might not like seeing us work together, so scratch that idea.
Well, whatever happens, happens. I reach out for the door...
But it's opened before my eyes and someone comes out.
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Arika】
Is that you, Hinata-senpa-- Over here!
【Masaya】
What?!
She suddenly grabs my hand and drags me away from the store entrance to a spot where we're out of sight.
【Masaya】
What is this about?
【Arika】
Mashiro can sense when someone she knows is at the restaurant. Like Tobisawa-senpai, she's literally never wrong.
【Masaya】
As if...
But not even a second later, the door opens. Mashiro pops out and looks around a bit.
Then, she shrugs to herself and heads back inside.
【Masaya】
...You sure she wasn't just trying to say bye to you or something?
【Arika】
Nah, doubt it. She prettied herself up.
【Masaya】
......
I didn't see anything different about her.
【Masaya】
Why do I even care if she sees me? I was going inside anyway.
【Arika】
Sorry, I just wanted to talk to you. On that note, sorry for the whole thing at Takafuji.
【Masaya】
Oh, yeah. You made me miss Mashiro's match.
She practically dragged me out here, so I at least have to throw a snide remark her way.
【Arika】
The guy she had a crush on really was you, huh? Who would've guessed.
...But she came back swinging.
【Masaya】
...Yeah.
【Arika】
I knew.
【Masaya】
Let me guess... Mashiro told you?
【Arika】
Neither of us would tell each other something like that. I just pretended like I knew so you'd spill the beans.
...And I totally fell for it.
【Arika】
Hm...
【Masaya】
Could you stop staring at me like that? It's pretty rude.
【Arika】
So, what'd you come to Mashiro's place for?
【Masaya】
What are you, her manager?
【Arika】
Tell me, and I'll tell you anything you want to know about Mashiro. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal, if you ask me.
【Masaya】
I wanted to go do something with her.
I can't say no to that offer.
【Arika】
Okay, okay.
After scratching her head for a few seconds, she looks at me again.
【Arika】
Let's go do something, then, just me and you!
【Masaya】
What? Why would I hang out with you?
I can only stare at her blankly. She threw out that suggestion like she thought she was a genius or something.
【Arika】
Don't you want all the sweet Mashiro stories I have to tell you?
【Masaya】
Absolutely, but I'm not going anywhere with you.
【Arika】
Oh, it'll be fine. Just think of me as a food taster or something, okay?
【Masaya】
How does that make anything better?
【Arika】
Well, you can't hang out with Mashiro. She's still working.
【Masaya】
......
【Arika】
Come on, what's the worst I could possibly do?
【Masaya】
Is that supposed to make me feel safe...?
【Masaya】
I can't believe I'm going on a date with <i>you</i> when I've never even gone on one with Mashiro.
【Arika】
Hey, Senpai! I want some ice cream!
【Masaya】
You're taking this way too seriously...
【Arika】
Well, why not enjoy ourselves if we're doing this anyway, you know?
【Masaya】
What are you after, Okoze?
【Arika】
You can call me Arika.
【Masaya】
Uh, okay?
【Arika】
I'll let anyone Mashiro likes call me that.
I spend a few seconds deliberating, then...
【Masaya】
Nah, I'll stick to Okoze.
【Arika】
Why?!
【Masaya】
It's not that important to me. Plus, if someone saw us together and heard me using your first name...
I suddenly feel a stare on my back. I turn around, but there's no one to be seen.
Confused, I look around some more and that's when I spy her...
【Rika】
......
In a completely different spot than where I felt that gaze is someone I happen to know. What a coincidence.
This isn't good...
I really just want to facepalm right now, but I suppress that urge and offer her an acknowledging nod.
I figured Ichinose would misread the situation, as she often does, and walk away with a judgmental smile on her face, but she's briskly walking this way.
Then, once she reaches us...
【Rika】
Hello, Hinata-san.
She offers a polite greeting.
【Arika】
Who's this girl? She looks real familiar...
【Rika】
Who's your friend, Hinata-san? I'd love for you to introduce us.
Ichinose's words are polite, but the stare she's giving me is ice cold.
That's hardly surprising. It's not like Mashiro or I have outright told her, but I think she has a pretty good idea that we're dating...
And now she sees me out around town with another girl...
【Masaya】
Okoze, this is Rika Ichinose from Takafuji Academy's FC Club. She moved to Shitou this spring, and she's my next-door neighbor.
【Arika】
Oh, right! She's the girl that flies really gracefully!
【Rika】
Wait, what? You play FC too...?
【Masaya】
Ichinose, this girl here is Arika Okoze. We went to the same middle school, but she's now a freshman at Suisan. She's also Mashiro's childhood friend.
【Arika】
You threw a bunch of unnecessary information in there.
【Masaya】
Every single thing I said was necessary.
Proving my point, Ichinose replies...
【Rika】
Oh, she's Mashiro's friend... That makes sense. I was thinking something entirely different...
【Masaya】
As in...?
【Rika】
Oh, um, don't worry about it.
She flashes a nervous smile after she says that.
【Rika】
I believed in you, I swear.
【Masaya】
Never thought I'd come to see a day when I no longer trusted that pure, innocent smile.
【Rika】
I thought I was witnessing a catastrophe for my friend! You can't blame me!
She fesses up surprisingly quick.
【Masaya】
It's fine. I know you were worried for Mashiro.
【Rika】
Hahaha...
【Arika】
Are you a friend of Mashiro's?
【Rika】
Yeah. We've been hanging out a lot lately.
【Arika】
Hm...
【Rika】
Um...?
After seeing Okoze probe her like a police officer would, I think of something wonderful.
【Masaya】
Yeah, Ichinose and Mashiro have been practicing FC together in their free time a lot. They've gotten super close. I'd call them besties, even.
【Rika】
O-Oh, we really aren't. I'd love to be that close to her someday, but I don't think we're there yet.
Ichinose appears to feel humbled. However, I'm not worried about her reaction.
【Arika】
Besties, huh...?
Okoze appears to be a bit offended.
【Rika】
So, um, why am I joining you two again...?
【Arika】
Don't worry about it. The more the merrier.
【Masaya】
Now you know how <i>I</i> feel.
【Rika】
Are you sure you aren't upset at me because I thought you were cheating...?
I feel bad for dragging Ichinose into this, but this is exactly what I expected to happen.
For whatever reason, Okoze tends to get jealous of people that are particularly close to Mashiro.
Though I doubt it's romantic jealousy. After all, Okoze has that "big sister" of hers.
【Rika】
So, um, if you don't mind me asking, what are we doing here today?
【Arika】
Just checking whether or not Hinata-senpai's capable of showing Mashiro a good time.
【Masaya】
Yeah, I don't think that's your business.
【Rika】
So our first stop is a cafe where we can discuss that?
【Masaya】
First stop? I don't know about you guys, but I'm done after this.
【Arika】
Well, Hinata-senpai didn't want to go to any places he could take Mashiro, so this cafe was the best compromise we could make.
【Masaya】
Did you really have to explain it in such fine detail?
I feel embarrassed now.
【Rika】
Oh, I can really tell how much you love her.
【Masaya】
Are you being sarcastic?
【Rika】
I meant it, really!
【Arika】
Without further ado, let's start the Kuna Island Mashiro quiz!
【Rika】
...What is that? Actually, I guess the title is a dead giveaway.
【Masaya】
That name sounds oddly familiar...
I'm sure they'd both vehemently deny it, but she and Mashiro have a lot in common.
【Arika】
Whoa, really? Can I really join your Speeder Alliance?
【Rika】
Sure. You're more than welcome to join us whenever you're free... Oh, but you go to Suisan, right? Aren't they a boarding school?
【Arika】
Yeah, but we're on summer break. Plus, even once we're back in school, I can get permission to leave on weekends if I don't have practice.
【Arika】
Oh, but don't tell Mashiro about this...
【Rika】
Of course. You can count on me. I'll tell her this was all my idea.
【Arika】
Thank you so much, Ichinose-san! No, Ichinose-sama! Rika-sama!
【Rika】
You can just call me Rika, Arika-chan.
【Arika】
Thank you, Rika!
【Arika】
Actually, I don't even need to join the Speeder Alliance now. We can just start up our own alliance. Oh, we could even call it the Rika-Rika alliance, since my name has "rika" in it.
【Rika】
I feel like that would make me a traitor...
【Masaya】
......
The Kuna Island Mashiro quiz ended some time ago. As expected, Okoze crushed us.
And these two girls have also gotten pretty chummy in that time.
【Masaya】
...Can I leave?
【Arika】
So, can you confirm something for me? Mashiro tells me whenever you guys practice late into the night, you always take her home.
Mashiro has been texting her childhood friend about me and bragging like crazy. This is something I already knew.
I'm not even a participant in their conversations, yet she uses this information like a weapon to keep me from leaving.
【Masaya】
Kgh...!
I don't know what she's after, but I'll just have to sit down and wait this out.
【Rika】
Oh, so you take her home? That's very nice of you.
【Masaya】
Yeah, what about it?
【Rika】
Oh, nothing. I'm just a little envious.
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Rika】
Oh, nevermind. Just ignore that little comment. On that note, I'm going to excuse myself for a moment.
【Arika】
Need to use the bathroom? See you later.
Ichinose gets up and leaves. Kinda feels like she was trying to hide something, but I don't know what.
Now it's just Okoze and me again.
【Arika】
Hinata-senpai, lean in for a second.
She brings her face closer to mine.
【Masaya】
What is it?
I do as she says.
【Arika】
Take care of Mashiro for me, please.
Her tone takes a sudden serious shift.
【Arika】
We don't see each other much anymore, but we've still been close since we were kids, so yeah.
【Masaya】
Yeah. You've known her even longer than Misaki, right?
【Arika】
Mhm. Back when we were kids, I got teased a whole lot because of my skin. You know, I'm really tan, so all the other kids would call me charcoal.
【Arika】
Mashiro was one of the few kids that always stuck up for me. Though, she just gave me a different nickname, so the teasing didn't really stop much.
【Arika】
Basically everyone treated us like two peas in a pod because of that nickname and Mashiro's name meaning what it does... so from then on, we were pretty much inseparable.
【Masaya】
Yeah, I think I've heard this story before.
【Arika】
Mashiro used to be a lot different back then. Before she met Tobisawa-senpai, she was basically just that girl with glasses who never talked.
【Masaya】
Wow, really?
【Arika】
Yeah, she was a pretty big introvert. Or well, she was just really socially awkward, so she stayed in her shell and avoided interacting with people as much as possible. That's also why she's really into video games.
【Arika】
I felt bad for her, though, because she gets super lonely, you know? She really wants to have people to talk to and stuff. Like, she'd even talk to her plushies for hours on end. She ever tell you about that?
【Masaya】
No, I don't think so.
【Arika】
Well, it's probably for the best that she got over that phase. Most people don't talk to plushies anymore at this age.
【Arika】
Yeah, so that's why Mashiro's mom, Auntie Botan, always showered her with attention and love. It kept her from getting all lonely and talking to her animals.
【Arika】
I bet you've noticed how much she dotes on her, haven't you? Though, it may just be her personality, honestly.
【Masaya】
I see...
Now that she mentions it, I can think of a few times I've gotten that impression.
【Arika】
That's the biggest reason why I hate Tobisawa-senpai... Well, I don't <i>hate</i> her, really, I just don't like how she always gives Mashiro the cold shoulder.
【Arika】
I know it's wrong for me to blame Tobisawa-senpai for Mashiro's problems. Plus, if Mashiro's fine with how Tobisawa-senpai treats her, it's none of my business.
【Arika】
But I just wish I could've been there for Mashiro. Unfortunately, we've had this sort of rivalry going on for ages, so I could never really be the kind of friend she needed.
【Masaya】
So, Okoze, you... Ngh?!
【Masaya】
So, Okoze, you....
Ngh?!
I have a number of things I want to ask her about, but before I can say anything, I feel a sharp gaze stabbing into me.
It's the same one I felt before we ran into Ichinose. I trace it to its origin and find...
【Mayu】
......
That's her "big sister"... isn't it?
She's sitting at a table behind Okoze, so she isn't visible from her view.
Plus, the look she's giving me is incredibly frightening.
...Don't tell me she's been watching us the whole day?!
That's a terrifying thought.
【Arika】
Something wrong, Hinata-senpai?
【Masaya】
No, it's nothing.
【Arika】
Is someone over there?
Okoze turns around.
【Arika】
...Nope.
With nimble movements, Okoze's big sister manages to hide herself from view.
The most impressive part is this seems to be something she's done on more than one occasion.
【Arika】
Hinata-senpai?
【Masaya】
Well, um...
She'll find out if I keep acting this suspicious in front of her.
【Masaya】
Just curious, Okoze. Do you love your big sister?
【Arika】
W-What? Wh-Wh-Wh-Where'd that question come from, you idiot?!
【Masaya】
Answer honestly if you can.
【Arika】
Well, true. I guess what I just said could be misinterpreted.
It doesn't look like she's caught on to why I'm asking her that question.
【Arika】
Well... O-O-O-Of course I love her. Stop trying to embarrass me.
She blushes, giving her answer in a voice so faint it's barely audible.
【Mayu】
......
Her big sister suddenly appears to be on cloud nine.
Unfortunately, Ichinose comes back right when I remember what I wanted to ask Okoze, and the conversation is cut short.
【Masaya】
...Hm?
I've been woken up by the sound of a knock against my window.
...Who could it be?
Still drowsy and half-asleep, I make my way over to it.
【Rika】
Hello, Hinata-san. It's been a while since we last talked through our windows like this, hasn't it?
【Masaya】
Oh, Ichinose. Hey.
【Rika】
Were you sleeping?
【Masaya】
It's fine. I fell asleep on my desk, so you did me a favor, really.
Everything starts coming back to me.
It's been a couple days since I went to the cafe with Okoze and Ichinose.
Since the end of summer break is closing in on us, I was frantically looking for somewhere I could take Mashiro on a date.
Then I finally found something... and...
【Rika】
I have a little FC-related question for you. Do you mind?
【Masaya】
No... I'd be glad to answer. I love FC.
【Rika】
......
【Masaya】
...What's wrong?
【Rika】
I was just a little shocked. See, I never took you for the kind of person who would say something like that out loud.
【Masaya】
......
Must be because I'm still half-asleep. My brain isn't working at full capacity.
Thinking back, I know I found somewhere to take Mashiro. What was it again?
...Oh right, a fireworks display. I wanted to invite her to go see some fireworks.
【Rika】
I like you more when you're honest and upfront about things like that.
And when Mashiro starts teasing me like always, I'll use that opportunity to...
【Masaya】
Do you wanna go see some fireworks with me?
【Rika】
...Um, come again?
【Masaya】
......
【Masaya】
Wait, what'd I just...?!
Oh shit!
【Rika】
......
My half-awake self just asked Ichinose out on a date instead of Mashiro!
The next day after practice.
【Botan】
Welcome to Mashiro Udon.
【Masaya】
Welcome to... Oh.
【Madoka】
Whoa! He's really here!
【Asuka】
Hi, Masaya-san!
Madoka arrived alongside Asuka. The latter calls out to me in a soft voice, waving her hand.
【Botan】
I'll leave these ladies to you, Masaya-kun.
I have more than a few mixed feelings about that tap on the shoulder from Botan-san, but I walk over to the girls anyway.
Guess they found out...
I knew it was bound to happen eventually.
But this is a paid job. Gotta draw a line between personal feelings and work.
【Madoka】
Hewwo, Hinata-kyun!
【Masaya】
Come right this way, Asuka. I'll show you to your table.
【Madoka】
You're forgetting someone! You're forgetting someone and she's standing right here in front of you!
【Masaya】
Oh, right. Sorry about that.
【Masaya】
10,000 yen order coming in, Botan-san!
【Madoka】
Why am I getting ripped off with no explanation?!
【Masaya】
It was just a joke. So, tell me, what the hell brings you two to Mashiro Udon on this fine day?
【Madoka】
You can try to sound as polite as you want, but that was plain rude!
【Asuka】
Um, are you mad that we came to see you, Masaya-san?
【Masaya】
No, I just don't like being teased.
【Madoka】
Just shrug it off!
【Masaya】
Look...
I bet Mashiro told them.
The fact that they specifically came at a time when the store isn't busy reminds me of that time I came here hoping to see Mashiro. That was when I got hired.
【Masaya】
Okay, so the Purgatory Miso Udon it is for Madoka. What would you like, Asuka?
【Masaya】
Okay, so the <color=#FF0000>Purgatory Miso Udon</color> it is for Madoka. What would you like, Asuka?
【Madoka】
Huh? Is this a casual precursor to my death or something?
【Masaya】
I'll pay.
【Madoka】
Sounds great!
Madoka nods with vigor... but little does she know that smile will be her last.
【Masaya】
-Fin-
【Madoka】
I think I'll go with the Cold Citrus Udon. Don't want to die today.
Smart call. Well, I guess anyone would've seen through my ruse...
【Asuka】
I'll take the same thing.
【Masaya】
Okay. Two Cold Citrus Udons it is.
【Asuka】
Is Mashiro-chan not here right now?
【Masaya】
Mashiro?
I thought she was the one who told them...? Or actually, maybe she sold me out to protect herself?
I suddenly feel a piercing gaze from behind me and a shiver runs down my spine.
【Masaya】
Mashiro's not... Mashiro-san is not here at the moment, no.
【Madoka】
...What the hell? Is there some kind of workplace bullying going on around here?
【Masaya】
Be careful what you say... Not a word about my relationship with Mashiro, okay?
I warn them in a hushed tone.
【Madoka】
Me sees.
Madoka gives me a firm nod.
【Madoka】
Your fate rests in our hands, laddie.
【Masaya】
So that was one Cold Citrus Udon and one Purgatory Miso Udon. Oh, you want the spiciness cranked up to ten? Sure thing. Coming right up.
【Masaya】
So that was one Cold Citrus Udon and one <color=#FF0000>Purgatory Miso Udon</color>. Oh, you want the spiciness cranked up to <color=#FF0000>ten</color>? Sure thing. Coming right up.
【Madoka】
Grr...
【Masaya】
......
【Madoka】
...Let us strike a bilateral hands-off deal, sir, please.
【Masaya】
So a Gentleman's Agreement... or Gentleman and Lady, in this case.
【Asuka】
That doesn't sound quite right...
Thankfully, they didn't bother me much after that, so I was able to do my work with little problem.
【Madoka】
Some of my friends went to this place, and they say it has a great selection.
【Asuka】
Wow, everything looks so cute! I'd love to go shopping there!
They're chatting away as they flip through a magazine spread out on their table. A typical sight.
They're the only customers still here, and I do enjoy seeing them act like typical girls their age, but there's just one problem...
【Botan】
Hm, I think I'm too old for an outfit like that.
For some reason, Botan-san is flipping through it with them, offering only the most contrite comments.
【Madoka】
Oh no, you'd <i>totally</i> be able to rock those, Botan-san!
Quit encouraging her.
【Botan】
Oh, you think so too?
Wow, she really pounced on that opportunity! Was she fishing for that comment or what?!
...Hm?
【Masaya】
Dunno why I didn't ask earlier, but where's Misaki? Did she not feel like coming?
Can't believe it slipped my mind.
【Asuka】
Yes. She said she wasn't in the mood.
【Masaya】
Really? Weird... Can't imagine her passing up on udon.
【Botan】
That sounds like a serious problem. Is her life at risk...?
【Masaya】
Wow. Her love for udon is <i>much</i> more serious than I thought.
【Madoka】
......
【Madoka】
Oh, get this, guys! I have the <i>perfect</i> spooky story to tell you!
【Masaya】
A ghost story?
【Madoka】
Even more scary, actually. It's about some relationship drama involving a guy and a girl.
【Masaya】
Some people--
Before I can finish my sentence, a possibility flashes through my mind.
【Masaya】
This better not be anything about me and Mashiro, you hear?
That definitely would be more "chilling" than a ghost story...
【Madoka】
It's not. I promise.
【Masaya】
Good...
【Asuka】
What were you about to say before you said that, Masaya-san?
【Masaya】
Huh? Oh, I was just gonna say some people really go crazy over relationship drama.
【Botan】
Botan Arisaka, BEEP years old. Her favorite word is drama.
【Madoka】
Madoka Aoyagi, ideal weight 38 kilograms. Her favorite things to google are cheating, affairs, revenge, alimony... and what else. Hm...
【Masaya】
Have fun.
I leave them to their own devices.
【Madoka】
So this is a story I heard from a friend of mine. Once upon a time, there was this perfectly average couple.
I'm off wiping tables, but Madoka's voice can be heard all throughout the store.
I have no idea why she's reciting it like a fairy tale, but whatever.
【Madoka】
Things were going great between him and his girlfriend, or at least they appeared to be. But one day, he made a move on a different girl. It is unclear whether his actions were spurred by impulse or a serious case of disloyalty.
Hm... I don't know the whole story, but from what I've heard, the guy sounds like a real dirtbag.
【Madoka】
He took his words back almost immediately. Who knows? Maybe it was all a misunderstanding, or he simply realized his wrongdoing and felt guilty.
At least he has a sense of decency.
【Madoka】
But apparently the other girl he asked out happened to be a super sweet, innocent girl.
【Madoka】
She was actually fairly fond of the guy herself and didn't even know he had a girlfriend, so when he tried to withdraw the invitation, she started crying.
Hang in there, buddy. It was all your fault, but you can still fix things.
【Madoka】
So, since the girl clearly wanted to go, and he felt guilty about taking back the invitation, he went to see the fireworks with her despite feeling really bad about what he'd accidentally done to his real girlfriend.
【Masaya】
Ah...!
My head slams right into table I've been wiping.
【Asuka】
What was that?!
【Madoka】
Don't kill yourself, Hinata-kun.
【Botan】
Did you slip and fall?
【Masaya】
I'm fine... Don't worry about me.
I raise my hand to signal that everything's okay.
I mean, can you honestly blame me for having a panic attack after hearing the word "fireworks"?
I'm reminded of the disaster with Ichinose...
Now that I think about it, Madoka's story shares a lot of similarities with it.
But Ichinose, unlike the girl in the story, didn't cry. She gave me a stern lecture on why what I did was wrong, and told me never to do it again.
She also told me I have to do one thing she says as an apology. That's happening after work today, and I'm not looking forward to it at all.
...Don't tell me Madoka knows all about this?
I stare Madoka down to see how she reacts.
【Madoka】
Hey, stop that... Stop leering at my body like that, you naughty boy.
What the hell does she think I'm doing? My attempt at communication has clearly failed.
【Asuka】
So, what happens next?
【Madoka】
Right, so back to where I left off. All throughout the fireworks display, the girl was gazing into the guy's eyes as he stood next to her.
【Asuka】
Wow, that's so cute!
【Botan】
She's so cunning!
【Asuka】
What?
【Botan】
Huh?
They look at each other, clearly confused.
I'm not commenting on this.
【Madoka】
So, the guy eventually noticed, and he was really taken aback by how adorable she was.
It does seem like a pretty sweet scene.
【Madoka】
Because of that, the guy also started taking notice of the girl.
【Madoka】
In the end, a fight broke out between the other girl and the girlfriend. The girlfriend ultimately gave up, and said the other girl was better for him.
I can picture that... and that doesn't make me feel very good.
【Madoka】
Any <i>real</i> man would've stuck up for his girlfriend, right?
【Masaya】
......
【Asuka】
What was the spooky part?
【Madoka】
Well, it seems like things are going well between the guy and the other girl right now.
【Botan】
That's just how it is sometimes.
【Madoka】
So, the moral of the story is, you have to gaze into your crush's eyes if you want them to notice you!
【Asuka】
I honestly wouldn't want to use unfair tactics like that...
【Botan】
But it works like a charm.
Madoka, Asuka, and Botan-san keep chatting away. There might actually be some truth to the old saying "Whenever three women gather, it gets noisy."
But man... that part about the fight breaking out between the other girl and the girlfriend has me a little worried.
The Speeder Alliance should be practicing together at this very moment.
...I hope everything's fine.
【Pig (Mashiro)】
This is rid-oinkulous, I say! We pigs are the rightful owners of the meat kingdom!
【Chicken (Mashiro)】
Cackawsterous! You are not! We chickens are the favored meat of the humans! You pigs can't even compete!
【Pig (Mashiro)】
Oinking around all high and mighty, are we, chicken? You will realize your foolishness once you try a bite of tonkatsu!
【Chicken (Mashiro)】
You shall regret saying that when you don't see any fried chicken in your lunchbox and cackaw in shock! Besides, you're already 20% less than when this battle started! Cackaw! You're finished!
【Pig (Mashiro)】
How dare you say that, you little oinker! I'll shove this hoof of mine right up your chickeny buttocks!
【Cow (Mashiro)】
Moo, moo! Stop fighting, guys!
【Chicken (Mashiro)】
C-Cackaw! Is that you, cow?
【Cow (Mashiro)】
This fighting is a mis-steak. It will not solve anything. We three ani-mool species already rule the meat kingdom. If you keep acting like silly calves, you're going to have to moo-ve aside because the sheep and horses will take your place.
【Pig (Mashiro)】
C-Cow...
【Chicken (Mashiro)】
Y-You have a cackawfully good point.
【Cow (Mashiro)】
Watching you two sore losers moo-ing and whining over who is number two is a sad sight.
【Pig (Mashiro)】
...What the oink did you just say?
【Chicken (Mashiro)】
Say it to my beak, you cow-ard!
【Cow (Mashiro)】
I'm a cow. I'm big beef. How can you little moo-nchkins even stand up to me when you can't even decide who is the best among you?
【Pig (Mashiro)】
I'm gonna beat you until you're oinking for Mommy!
【Chicken (Mashiro)】
Cackaw-m and fight me, you cow-ard!
【Mashiro】
......
【Mashiro】
I didn't expect that to happen. What now?
【Rika】
...What are you doing?
【Mashiro】
Huuuh!
【Rika】
Um, do you do this every day while I'm downstairs getting the tea and snacks ready?
【Mashiro】
Oh, Rika! This magazine of yours looks cool. Can I borrow it?
【Pig (Rika)】
You won't pull my hoof with that.
【Mashiro】
Kgh...!
【Chicken (Rika)】
I want a detailed explanation! Cackaw-ph it up!
【Cow (Rika)】
Quit moo-ing around the subject. Give us the full story.
【Mashiro】
B-Boy, it sure is hot today. Can I close the window and crank up the AC?
【Rika】
No, you can't!
【Mashiro】
Oh, sorry for asking.
【Rika】
Well, see, putting the AC up too high is bad for your health. And if it gets too bad, you might go back to talking to...
【Mashiro】
Why do you keep bullying me?! To begin with, these are all <i>your</i> plushies!
【Rika】
Okay, I'll stop talking about it. Anyway, here's our tea and snacks for today.
【Mashiro】
......
【Rika】
Yeah?
【Mashiro】
It's nothing. It just kind of hit me how good you are at cooking and baking. You're the kind of girl guys dream of. I'm really jealous.
【Rika】
I'm nothing compared to you.
【Mashiro】
That has to be sarcasm, or just empty flattery at least. There's no way you're being serious...
【Mashiro】
Okay, I guess we'd better get started with today's meeting.
【Mashiro】
Oh, hold on. I have a piece of paper with all the moves I wanted to ask you about.
【Mashiro】
Um, so I noticed this move you've been doing lately where you fly upward and...
【Rika】
Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Hm? Oh, this tea really hits the spot.
【Rika】
Thanks... So, I have a question. How long have you and Hinata-san been dating?
【Mashiro】
PFFFT!
【Mashiro】
Ack... Ugh... Ack...!
【Rika】
Here, use these tissues and the towel to wipe everything up.
【Mashiro】
Th-Thanks... Ack... Ugh...
【Mashiro】
Y-You can't just ask me something like that out of the blue...
【Rika】
But I'm curious.
【Rika】
So, how long has it been?
【Mashiro】
How long have I...? Hold up, hooold up! You've got this all wrong!
【Rika】
You're not dating?
【Mashiro】
Well, I mean... we <i>are,</i> yeah.
【Rika】
He's really handsome, don't you think?
【Mashiro】
Well, everyone has different opinions on looks. Like, someone who has a crush on him would probably say that, but me...
【Mashiro】
......
【Mashiro】
...Wait, what?
【Rika】
You know what? Hinata-san actually invited me to go to a fireworks display with him last night.
【Mashiro】
What...?
【Rika】
......
【Mashiro】
Senpai invited you...?
【Mashiro】
...You, not me?
【Rika】
Ah...
【Rika】
Hahah... just kidding.
【Mashiro】
I'm sorry!
【Rika】
Huh?
【Mashiro】
I thought you already knew about me and Senpai, so I never brought it up or anything.
【Mashiro】
I'm sorry! I'm really, <i>really</i> sorry!
【Rika】
Wait, wait, hold up! I did know. I really did, for the most part.
【Mashiro】
See, I have someone I like.
【Rika】
Wow, she's really just tuning me out!
【Mashiro】
My initial reason for joining the Speeders Alliance was really just so I could get more chances to see him. I lied to you about everything.
【Mashiro】
Oh, but that doesn't mean I regret becoming friends, Rika. I really do like you, I promise.
【Rika】
Stop monologuing and come back to reality! I am happy to hear that you like me, though.
【Mashiro】
But no matter how much I like you as a friend, I can't just let you...
【Rika】
Mashiro...
【Mashiro】
I can't let you have Senpai, no matter what!
【Rika】
......
【Mashiro】
I'm sorry!
【Mashiro】
I know I'm not as pretty as you, and I suck at FC, and he's never invited me to go see fireworks with him...
【Mashiro】
But I made the decision to be Senpai's girlfriend! That's the one thing I won't give up on! I worked as hard as I could to make him mine!
【Mashiro】
So I'm sorry.
【Rika】
I know! I want you to be with him!
【Mashiro】
...Huh?
【Rika】
About time? You wouldn't listen to a word I was saying. Were you really that stressed out? Well, I guess it <i>was</i> all my fault.
【Rika】
I feel so guilty right now...
【Mashiro】
Huh? What?
【Rika】
I have to say, you really shocked me there. I was afraid you were going to start crying. That's a good thing, though. I wish I could feel as strongly about someone as you do for him.
【Mashiro】
...Um, can you explain?
【Rika】
Hinata-kun did invite me to a fireworks display, but only because he was tired and thought he was talking to you. Still, I think he should've been more careful. That was incredibly rude.
【Rika】
So, you see, I wanted to give him a little punishment.
【Mashiro】
You can giggle all cutesy like that, but what you just said was kind of creepy...
【Rika】
H-Hey, it wasn't me who came up with the idea! I mean, I thought what he did was wrong, but Mado--!
【Mashiro】
I feel like I heard a name there right before you covered your mouth.
【Rika】
Well, anyway! Hinata-san?
Ichinose shouts out her window, and since mine is open as well, I can hear her clearly.
【Mashiro】
Senpai?!
【Masaya】
Yeah?
【Rika】
What are you waiting for? Are you not going to come over here and give your girlfriend a hug?
【Masaya】
Sorry, I just couldn't find the right time.
Frankly, I almost jumped over there on multiple occasions.
【Rika】
The original plan was actually for Mashiro to get really upset and be like, "He's so awful!" Then, you'd have to come over and apologize a bunch to get her to forgive you.
How is that anything but torture?
【Mashiro】
That's the kind of person you think I am...?
【Masaya】
Who were you saying came up with this? Mado-something...?
【Rika】
Your girlfriend really loves you, Hinata-san! Aren't you glad?
【Masaya】
Don't ignore my question.
That said, I think I understand everything now.
The master manipulator who set this all up is probably a certain someone who came over to Mashiro Udon earlier to fan the flames, so to speak.
...I was genuinely scared because of her little "story."
Well, I guess she had a feeling it would all work out in the end. Not sure whether I should attribute that to blind optimism or her having actual trust in us.
Actually, how'd she even find out about this? It only happened one night ago. I guess information spreads like wildfire among girls...
【Rika】
Hinata-san. Don't hurt Mashiro's feelings anymore, even if it's by accident. The people who care about her don't want to see her treated that way.
【Masaya】
I'll take that to heart.
【Rika】
Also, you need to cherish her more than you already do.
【Masaya】
Of course. I swear I will.
【Mashiro】
Ah...
【Rika】
Good.
Ichinose seems pleased. I also get the feeling that Mashiro is blushing over there by the faint noises she's making.
【Rika】
Okay, I'll leave you two alone now. And, Hinata-san, I know you might not like it, but she's going to be giving you a piece of her mind.
【Masaya】
I guess my punishment doesn't end here.
【Mashiro】
Huh? Wait, Rika, where are you...?
I hear the door opening, which must mean she's actually leaving.
She ordered me to stay in my room as the "one thing she says that I have to do," but this isn't quite what I expected when she said that.
I'm gonna have to start explaining to Mashiro, so where do I even begin?
【Mashiro】
Senpai...?
【Masaya】
Hm?
I gotta say something...
【Mashiro】
Was Rika right?
【Masaya】
What'd she say?
【Mashiro】
The thing about you... coming over here and giving me a hug.
【Masaya】
Step away from the window for a sec!
I climb up on my window and fly through the air without the assistance of my Grav Shoes.
【Masaya】
...Kgh!
The force of the impact is so strong that I immediately lose my balance, but I get up quickly.
Now, where's Mashiro...?
【Mashiro】
Senpai!
【Masaya】
Mashiro!
【Mashiro】
Senpai!
【Masaya】
Mashiro!
We fly into each other's arms, driven by some invisible force.
【Mashiro】
Senpai...! Senpaaai...!
She rubs her body against me affectionately, like a stray kitten.
【Mashiro】
God, you have no idea how scared I was!
【Masaya】
I'm sorry, Mashiro. I love you.
I gently embrace my sweet Mashiro to tell her everything's fine.
Her small, slender frame feels incredibly soft and feeble. I almost don't want to squeeze too hard out of a fear that I'll break her.
I have so much I need to say to her. I haven't even given her a proper explanation as to how and why this all happened.
But first...
【Mashiro】
...Senpai?
I put my hands on her shoulders and put some distance between us.
I want to see her face, her beautiful eyes...
And then...
【Masaya】
Ah...!
【Mashiro】
Ah...
First, I nuzzle my forehead against hers.
Then, I close my eyes and gently kiss her forehead.
Her forehead feels a bit hot.
After that, I slowly peel my lips away.
I feel her soft bangs gently brush my nose as I pull away.
And as I do, I look at Mashiro with a loving and proud expression on my face. Unfortunately, she looks less than pleased.
【Mashiro】
You took the easy way out.
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Mashiro】
I don't mind getting kissed on the forehead, but right now I want a kiss somewhere else.
【Masaya】
...I'll admit I was nervous, but that's not the reason I kissed you on the forehead.
【Mashiro】
Did you not feel how strong my love for you is?
【Masaya】
I did. I can tell you love me a whole lot, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Then don't chicken out now.
【Masaya】
It's not like I'm...
【Mashiro】
I'll always stay loyal to you, Senpai. I'll never leave you for as long as I live.
【Masaya】
Ah...
I finally feel like I understand what she's trying to say.
It all comes back to the perfectly blue sky we once talked about.
She's referring to the sadness and defeat I experienced as a kid when my wings crumbled and I fell from the sky I so loved.
That's what she means by staying loyal to me. She'll never betray me or my love for her.
I realize it now...
This is true love.
It's what caused that emotional outburst with Ichinose earlier.
【Masaya】
...Don't worry. I'm not having any of those thoughts.
【Mashiro】
So what, am I just not attractive enough for you? We have a real big problem on our hands if that's the case.
【Masaya】
No, I just want to cherish you, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Then cherish me.
【Mashiro】
I want you to love me and treat me right.
【Masaya】
I will.
【Masaya】
I love you, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Mmmph?!
I opted for a bit of a surprise attack, which is probably why she lets out a not very romantic yelp through her sealed lips.
But I ignore that and close my eyes. Hm, this <i>is</i> how you kiss a girl, right?
【Mashiro】
Mmmmph... Mmm...
She's blowing air out through her nose, clearly not sure how to kiss for the first time.
She might get upset at me for this, since I essentially broke the promise I made to cherish her by stealing her lips so suddenly.
I'm a bit afraid, but I deserve it.
If she's upset, I'll let her give it to me.
And after that, I'll thank her one more time.
【Mashiro】
Mmmph...
Our lips part, and after that, we simply gaze longingly into each other's eyes.
I feel a mix of nervousness, embarrassment, and excitement.
【Masaya】
Oh, right.
I finally remember something important.
【Masaya】
Don't be mad at Ichinose for this. It all my fault, and I take all the blame for it. I really screwed up.
【Mashiro】
Oh, I don't blame her.
【Mashiro】
I mean, she gave me the opportunity to share my first kiss with you. I'm grateful, if anything.
【Mashiro】
Hehehe...
After seeing that adorable laugh...
【Masaya】
I see.
I've re-evaluated what cherishing my girlfriend means.
【Asuka】
It looks like everything went well. That's good.
【Rika】
Yeah, um, I feel we may have gone a bit too far.
【Madoka】
Really? But that was already the light version of the plan...
【Rika】
Th-That was light...?
【Madoka】
Didn't go quite as planned, unfortunately. But hey, it's nothing to worry about. Their relationship won't break that easily.
【Asuka】
You did a great job, Rika-chan. I <i>could</i> tell you were a little uncomfortable, though.
【Rika】
I just want to be a good friend... That's why I wanted him to realize why what he did was wrong, and why he needs to treat my friend better.
【Rika】
But in retrospect, maybe I should've stayed out of it. I mean, it was only momentary, but I did end up hurting Mashiro. I'll have to apologize to her later.
【Madoka】
Nah, Hinata-kun was the only one who did anything wrong. You did what you did for Mashirocchi's sake, so you deserve some praise!
【Asuka】
I agree. I don't know if she'll necessarily praise you, but I'm sure she isn't mad at you.
【Madoka】
And I think <i>I</i> deserve a little praise too, for the same reason!
【Asuka】
Um, I don't know if I agree...
【Madoka】
Oh, <i>come on,</i> Asuka-chan. Look me in the eye when you're talking to me.
【Rika】
Do you really think everything's going to be fine?
【Asuka】
Of course. You did it all with pure intentions. And both of them are really kind, so as long as they understand, they'd never get upset with you.
【Madoka】
Pin all the blame on me! Fact is, I came up with everything and even made you carry out my dastardly plan for me! Pretty criminal, huh?
【Rika】
I'm not sure criminal is a word you want to describe yourself with...
【Madoka】
Hm, I feel I might be in some legit danger here. Let me go take a tiny peek at how those two are doing...
【Rika/Asuka】
Oh no you don't!
【Asuka】
Oh no you don't!
【Rika】
Oh no you don't!
【Madoka】
You guys are scaring me...
【Madoka】
Well, with that out of the way, there's only one thing left to do.
【Asuka】
What are those, Madoka-chan?
【Madoka】
I made confetti! As they cuddle, they'll look at the window and gaze in awe at this miraculous gift raining down from the night sky!
【Rika】
I don't think that's how confetti is supposed to be used.
【Madoka】
Who cares. Come on, take some, girls. We're doing this. Throw them up real high on three, got it?
【Madoka】
One, two, three... Merry Christmas!
【Asuka】
Wow!
【Rika】
I feel like we just ruined everything.
【Madoka】
Hehehe... Say what you will. But eventually, when our babies are all grown up, this memory will spread its beautiful wings like the ugly duckling...
【Masaya】
Whoa, the hell is that...? Confetti?!
【Mashiro】
Senpai! Someone has to be watching us from outside!
【Madoka】
Okay, girls. Let's scram!
【Rika/Asuka】
Seriously?!
【Asuka】
Seriously?!
【Rika】
Seriously?!
On the topic of the fireworks...
【Botan】
This restaurant actually provides a very nice view of the fireworks, so we're always understaffed around that time.
【Masaya】
...What?
【Mashiro】
Oh, that's right! I was so caught up in everything that I totally forgot!
【Botan】
Don't worry, you two can go and see the fireworks. W-We'll manage here somehow.
【Masaya】
I'll stay and help.
And so, we had to postpone our first official date yet again.
Well, at least waiting tables for the flood of customers that came in that day made for a good workout.
The final day of our summer break is now upon us.
It started like any other day with practice.
But, unlike any other day, I didn't go to work, and Mashiro didn't go to Ichinose's place. We're both in my room right now.
Today being the final day of summer break means we have to finish up the remainder of Mashiro's homework.
【Masaya】
Stop looking around everywhere.
【Mashiro】
I-I'm sorry.
【Masaya】
I'm not hiding anything interesting in here. Now come on, your mom asked me to help you get your homework done, so we have to do this.
【Mashiro】
R-Right...!
Mashiro gives a stiff, but obedient response, then starts walking like a robot, putting both her right hand and leg forward at the same time... and sits down on my bed.
【Masaya】
Hey, what are you doing?
【Mashiro】
Huh...? What? Oh, sorry!
She gets right off the bed.
【Masaya】
Didn't get enough sleep last night? Do you wanna hop in bed for a bit?
【Mashiro】
Ah!
【Masaya】
No, I didn't mean it like <i>that,</i> okay?!
Not that I even know how she interpreted my words...
【Mashiro】
...So you want to take a nap together?
【Masaya】
No, not that either. <i>You</i> can take a nap.
【Mashiro】
O-Of course... Hahahaha...
Mashiro gets away from my bed, clearly embarrassed.
【Masaya】
...Maybe when we're done with your homework.
【Mashiro】
Ah!
Mashiro has good ears, so she easily picks up on my whisper and flinches.
Seeing confirmation that she understood what I meant gets my own heart racing.
【Mashiro】
L-Let's hurry and get this homework over with, then.
【Masaya】
Y-Yeah.
We both smile awkwardly at each other.
The reason for our embarrassment doesn't even need to be said.
Mashiro and I are almost certainly going to take our relationship to the next level before the day ends.
How do I know that? Today is the last day of our summer break, so there's a lot of sentimental value to it.
Or maybe it's the fact that we usually study in Mashiro's room, but today we're in mine. By her request...
【Mashiro】
I-If you don't mind, um, I'd like to do my homework in your room today...!
That look in her eyes told me everything. And even then, her breaths seemed slightly erotic, and the atmosphere was pretty rosy too.
As time passed and we watched each other's reactions, we both found ourselves more and more eager to do it today.
And that sums up why I'm so ridiculously nervous right now.
【Masaya】
O-Okay, let's sit down...
【Mashiro】
Yeah...
Before taking a seat, she closes the curtains for no particular reason.
【Masaya】
Why are you closing the curtains, Mashiro?
But she doesn't pull them open again. After a brief pause, I slowly slide toward the door for some reason and lock it behind my back.
【Mashiro】
Wh-Why'd you just lock the door?
Likewise, I don't unlock the door after she questions my actions.
【Masaya】
Oh, uh, that's a good question...
【Mashiro】
Y-You don't <i>have</i> to answer... I didn't really want you to...
Our conversation grinds to an unnatural halt.
【Masaya】
L-Let's sit down.
【Mashiro】
Yeah.
She plops down right next to me.
【Mashiro】
......
Every single action of hers screams that she wants to get down and dirty.
I want to take her in my arms so bad.
But the homework needs to be finished first.
【Masaya】
Kgh...!
I summon all the self-restraint I have in me to suppress my raging desire. The veins on my temples are even visible.
I've been helping her long enough to know how fast she goes. We're looking at about another hour before it's all done.
I have to hold out at least that long.
【Masaya】
Let's get it going.
【Mashiro】
Huh...?! Oh, y-yeah! Um, I have no experience whatsoever, but I'll try my best to--!
【Masaya】
Huh? Sorry, I meant your homework.
【Mashiro】
Right, of course! Haha, silly me!
【Masaya】
...But we can, um, do what you're thinking of after we're finished.
【Mashiro】
Got it! I-I'll get my homework done ASAP!
【Masaya】
Y-Yeah, that's the spirit!
...I don't even want to know how red my face is right now.
After that, I watch over Mashiro with bated breath as she hurries to finish her homework.
All my own homework is done and I'm much too distracted to do anything else.
Whenever she finishes a problem, we hold hands and sometimes entwine our fingers. Then, she moves on to the next.
And finally...
【Mashiro】
A-All done...!
The moment she finishes that final problem, she throws her pen to the side and leaps into my arms.
【Mashiro】
Senpai! Senpai! Senpai!
【Masaya】
Yeah, you did it, Mashiro. Good job.
The way she's rubbing her head against my chest affectionately is too hard to handle.
【Mashiro】
Senpai, I want a reward...
She looks up at me with her face still buried in my chest.
【Masaya】
Okay... But this is a reward for both of us. You're not the only one who wants to do this.
【Mashiro】
I'm so happy, Senpai...
My heart is racing like never before.
It's so bad that I think I might keel over at any moment.
I swallow the saliva that's built up in my mouth as my mind goes blank.
I can no longer tell if I have any self-control or composure left in me.
As she brings her face close to mine, I softly place my hand on her cheek.
The air from the AC starts blowing the pages of Mashiro's book one after another.
Must've been blocking its path before I moved.
I listen to the dull sound of paper flapping, then look over and see... blank pages.
My thoughts grind to a halt, but for a different reason altogether.
【Mashiro】
Senpai...
【Masaya】
Mashiro.
I put my hands on her slender shoulders.
【Mashiro】
Promise me you'll be real gentle...
【Masaya】
Mashiro... I need to tell you something.
I lightly jostle her shoulders.
【Mashiro】
Is it important...?
I see that some reason has returned to her intoxicated eyes, which means me shaking her shoulders worked like a charm.
【Masaya】
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but...
I hold up her book.
She managed to skip two whole pages of problems. Maybe they were stuck together or something?
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
Naturally, she's rendered speechless.
【Mashiro】
Nghhhhhh!
【Masaya】
Groaning and making a pouty face isn't going to change anything!
【Mashiro】
Hic... Hic...
【Masaya】
Come on, don't cry. It's not your fault. You couldn't have known the pages were stuck together.
Honestly, I feel like crying too.
【Mashiro】
But...
【Mashiro】
It's the last day of summer break! Our chance to do something special to cap off our first summer as a couple!
【Masaya】
I know, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
You could've at least waited until I was about to go home before saying something!
I really wish that was an option.
But I can't betray the trust placed in me by her parents. That wouldn't be a good idea, considering our future together and all.
【Masaya】
How many problems do you have left?
【Mashiro】
Just one... and now I'm done.
【Masaya】
Good job. I'm proud of you, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
But the mood's totally dead.
【Masaya】
Yeah... Wanna pick up where we left off?
【Mashiro】
Everything feels so forced that I can't possibly get into it!
【Masaya】
Right. Gotta do something about that...
I turn toward Mashiro and embrace her.
【Mashiro】
S-Senpai...?!
【Masaya】
How about this? We'll start over from square one.
【Mashiro】
Wh-What? Um, uh...
【Mashiro】
Senpai, do you... want to have sex?
Being asked that directly is <i>totally</i> embarrassing.
【Masaya】
...Yeah, I'm a little turned on.
【Mashiro】
I <i>was</i> turned on, but it's gone now...
【Masaya】
I see...
【Mashiro】
Wait!
I'm about to let go of her, but she stops me.
【Mashiro】
Don't let go of me, Senpai.
【Masaya】
I know this sounds cheesy, but I don't want to have sex if you're not in the mood...
【Mashiro】
Well, it's the girlfriend's job to respond to her boyfriend's needs. It makes me really glad that I can turn you on.
【Mashiro】
Plus, you never really say stuff like that to me.
【Masaya】
I feel like I do a decent bit.
【Mashiro】
Only if I make you... You're always being too considerate of me.
【Masaya】
No, I'm just a chicken...
【Mashiro】
Mmmph...
She sneaks in a quick kiss.
【Mashiro】
My boyfriend's no chicken.
I've made up my mind now. I'm going to do this.
【Masaya】
Sorry.
【Mashiro】
Ah!
I pick Mashiro up in my arms.
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
Then, I lay her down on my bed.
How do I even begin to describe this sight? It's surreal.
Whenever she wriggles her body slightly, the bed creaks, making my nerves heighten to frightening levels.
She takes a deep breath.
【Mashiro】
My heart is racing a mile a minute. Every time I breathe, I feel like I'm inhaling your smell, and it's making me feel really embarrassed.
【Mashiro】
My heart's beating so fast that my mind's numb. I feel all dizzy, like I'm on anesthetics.
【Masaya】
I can smell you too right now, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
What do I smell like?
【Masaya】
It's a sweet, feminine smell that feels intoxicating. But on the other hand, it lets me know how close you are to me right now.
I'm not even touching her, but I can feel her.
I can feel the heat radiating off my girlfriend, Mashiro Arisaka's, body.
And that's a sign that she wants to do this as bad as I do.
The love I feel for her right now in this moment is overwhelming.
I can tell from the way she's gazing up at me that she's super nervous. And for good reason. I'm just as nervous myself.
...Shortly after I think about what kind of face I'm making, I relax the muscles in my face.
【Masaya】
Let's kiss.
【Mashiro】
......
She gives a small, embarrassed nod.
I move in toward her lovely face, taking care not to accidentally step on her long hair.
But before I give her a kiss, I softly nuzzle my forehead against hers.
【Masaya】
You're a little tense. Try relaxing some.
【Mashiro】
I-I don't know.
【Masaya】
...Don't know what?
【Mashiro】
Um, what I'm supposed to do.
【Masaya】
Not sure I follow.
【Mashiro】
Well, I know you're going to kiss me a lot right now. You are, right?
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Mashiro】
But what comes after that?
【Masaya】
What are you getting at?
【Mashiro】
I mean, I have a general idea of what you're supposed to do. Well, only a very general, vague idea. Nothing specific...
【Mashiro】
I, um, do know how sex works, though. At least, for the most part. I don't have any real experience, so I can't be too certain.
【Masaya】
Hm...
【Mashiro】
But the problem is, I can't think of what we're supposed to do before we actually get to that point. Nothing comes to mind at all.
【Masaya】
...Now that you mention it, I've never thought about that either.
【Mashiro】
Not knowing is scary. I don't know what to do.
【Mashiro】
What if I can't satisfy you? Or what if I let out some weird noise and that immediately kills your interest? I'm really scared right now.
【Mashiro】
I probably don't need to tell you, but my body's nothing to boast about...
She informs me of that almost apologetically.
【Mashiro】
B-But I'm ready for anything. Anything you want to do, just say it. I trust you.
【Mashiro】
I-I probably won't do a good job, but I'll try! I'll try <i>really</i> hard! So please don't hate me if I end up sucking...
【Masaya】
That's enough.
I give her a light chop on the forehead.
【Mashiro】
Ouch...
【Masaya】
Man, once you got started, you just wouldn't stop.
【Mashiro】
Ugh...
Admittedly, I didn't interrupt her because I thought it was cute, but that's beside the point.
【Masaya】
Mashiro. Can you lift up your body a little? Okay, good. First, let me take your arms out and...
【Mashiro】
Huh...? Ah...
I take her brown cardigan off and put it to the side.
【Masaya】
I like just the white uniform top. It's a good look on you.
【Mashiro】
It'll get all wrinkled...
There's nothing more adorable than that worried look on her face. It's like she's trying to hide her embarrassment by mentioning her cardigan getting wrinkled.
But who am I to say? Maybe she's actually legitimately worried.
Anyway...
【Masaya】
It'll be fine, Mashiro. It's the boyfriend's job to calm his girlfriend down when she freaks out.
I borrow a phrase she used earlier.
【Mashiro】
...You didn't have to say it like I was going insane.
【Masaya】
I'll take care of everything, so just lay there and relax.
I hope she gets what I'm trying to do.
【Masaya】
And don't worry about keeping your voice down. I wanna hear you moan.
【Mashiro】
...You won't hear any moans out of me!
【Masaya】
We'll see about that!
We're currently en-route to Mashiro Udon.
I'm taking Mashiro home by paired flight.
【Mashiro】
Mmm, Senpai...!
【Masaya】
H-Hey, not too close!
【Mashiro】
My lower half hurts too much for me to fly, so you'll just have to deal with it!
When Mashiro got out of bed and tried walking, her waist started hurting and she told me she might have trouble walking. That's why she's flying with me.
【Masaya】
You say that like you're glad.
【Mashiro】
I've caught on to your ways, Senpai. Whenever you act all moody, that just means you're embarrassed.
【Masaya】
Quiet.
I wrap my arm around her and pull her into a tight embrace.
【Mashiro】
Hehehe. I'll make sure I can fly by tomorrow morning for practice. Wouldn't be good if our coach ended up making one of his players skip practice, right?
【Masaya】
You've got that right. But if you can't, that's fine. Don't rush it.
The starry sky looks so much more beautiful than usual on this night.
I'll probably never forget this sight.
That's how the last day of our summer break concluded.
The 24th of September, the date of the fall tournament is quickly approaching. Morale is on the rise, and everything seems to be going well.
Until, all of a sudden... Misaki stops showing up to practice.
【Mashiro】
Misaki-senpai.
【Misaki】
...Oh.
【Mashiro】
Can we talk?
【Misaki】
If it doesn't take too long, yeah.
【Mashiro】
Why aren't you coming to practice anymore?
【Misaki】
Why should I? I'm not even a member. I was only coming out of the goodness of my heart. Or, well, mostly just 'cause I was bored.
【Mashiro】
I want you to come back.
【Misaki】
Hm, sorry. Not happening.
【Mashiro】
What, did you quit because you weren't having fun anymore? I'll train as much as I can, so maybe then I'll be a worthy opponent.
【Misaki】
Sorry. I'm not hungry for battle or anything.
【Mashiro】
I mean, okay, but still...
【Misaki】
I'm sure you know better than anyone else why you really want to improve. Your hint is Masaya! Oh, I guess that's the whole answer.
【Mashiro】
Why are you giving up on FC? Tell me, please!
【Misaki】
...I just don't wanna bother with it anymore.
【Misaki】
I got bored of spinning around in the air like a plane. It's not for me.
【Mashiro】
You can't be serious...
【Misaki】
If you wanna keep playing, then go for it. But I won't be there.
【Mashiro】
But I thought...
【Misaki】
Hm?
【Mashiro】
......
【Misaki】
What?
【Mashiro】
I thought you had talent.
【Misaki】
Heh...
【Mashiro】
Huh?
【Misaki】
Yeah, you're right. Guess it got boring 'cause I was too good.
【Mashiro】
I-I'm going to...!
【Misaki】
Hm?
【Mashiro】
I'm going to beat you!
【Misaki】
......
【Mashiro】
I finally feel like I'm on the same playing field as you.
【Misaki】
Yeah, you've been working real hard, so I guess you are.
【Misaki】
Hm...
【Misaki】
Okay! Challenge declined.
【Mashiro】
Why?
【Misaki】
I mean, I don't have a reason to fight you. There's nothing to get me fired up and excited.
【Misaki】
I kinda regret not entering the fall tournament now.
【Misaki】
Then we could've just had our match there. And if one of us got knocked out before that, automatic loss! Something like that.
【Mashiro】
So I just have to get you in the fall tournament...? Fine.
【Masaya】
Yeah, there's no way.
【Masaya】
The tournament is on the 24th of this month. It's too late for applications.
【Mashiro】
Huh? Wait, so she can't enter the tournament?
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Mashiro】
B-But she's going to quit FC for good at this rate!
【Masaya】
I know.
【Mashiro】
That's all you're going to say...? Didn't we make a promise to bring Misaki-senpai back?
【Masaya】
Yeah. Our initial plan was to show her how hard we were working, and hopefully all the fun we were having would rub off on her.
【Masaya】
But now she's running further away... At this rate, I doubt we'd get her back even if we took home 1st place at the tournament.
【Mashiro】
What do we do, Senpai?
【Masaya】
...I'm not sure there's anything we <i>can</i> do.
【Masaya】
I wanted her to come back, but only if she quit for no real reason.
【Masaya】
I can't object if she has a real, serious reason for quitting.
After all, I once did the same thing...
【Mashiro】
...But I don't want to see her leave like this.
【Masaya】
That's how it always is. But we still have to respect her wishes.
【Mashiro】
I just want to do something for her...
【Masaya】
I understand. I care about her just as much as you do. But forcing her back against her will won't accomplish anything. We'd have to change her mind.
【Mashiro】
Misaki-senpai's never honest.
【Masaya】
Sure, but it doesn't really seem like she wants our help.
When I quit, the last thing I wanted was people telling me to make a comeback.
【Mashiro】
Years ago, when I was in a really rough spot in life, Misaki-senpai reached out and gave me her hand.
【Mashiro】
I don't think I'll ever forget that day.
【Mashiro】
But I don't know what I can even say to her that might do something...
Practice continues as the fall tournament looms.
Mashiro is practicing just as hard as ever...
But I can see her morale dwindling. Slowly, but surely.
【Masaya】
Welcome to--!
【Masaya】
You can have a seat at this table.
【Misaki】
......
Misaki, of all people, shows up at Mashiro Udon.
I bring her udon over to her table and place it in front of her.
【Misaki】
How've you been doing?
This is the first time she's tried to strike up an actual conversation with me since she entered.
【Masaya】
Can't you tell? We see each other at school.
【Misaki】
Yeah, and you never talk to me.
【Masaya】
I just don't know what to talk about. I mean, there's a million things I want to ask you, so it's kind of hard.
【Masaya】
That's why I just decided to wait and believe.
【Misaki】
Boy, you really love Mashiro a whole lot, don't you?
【Masaya】
I was talking about <i>you</i> there, Misaki.
【Misaki】
For real?
【Masaya】
Well... I've just decided to think of you all like my kids, and you know kids. Cute as they are, they love nothing more than to be disobedient. So yeah, thanks to you guys, I feel like an old man...
【Misaki】
Hahaha...
Misaki proceeds to slurp her noodles.
【Masaya】
Well, Mashiro's the one who really trusts you. A lot more than me, in fact.
【Misaki】
Sorry. As an apology, one noodle of mine is thine.
【Masaya】
If you wanted a good pun, you should've said "nine" instead of one.
I slurp the noodle she holds out to me with her chopsticks.
【Misaki】
Man, this is way out of character for me.
【Masaya】
What do you mean?
【Misaki】
It won't stop nagging me! Actually, goosing! It won't stop goosing me!
【Masaya】
Do you even know what that means? Why would you even use that word?
【Misaki】
I just wish you guys gave up on me earlier.
I can't follow her.
【Masaya】
What would that accomplish? Like, what do you even mean by that?
【Misaki】
Hm, knowing me, I think I probably would've become a hermit.
【Masaya】
A what?
【Misaki】
I'd travel the world and spend all my time in arcades and stuff.
【Masaya】
Pfft!
【Misaki】
Hey, what was that for?! I'll do what I gotta do!
【Masaya】
Well, let's get back on-topic.
【Misaki】
I don't like how you're avoiding this.
【Misaki】
Hell, you're partly to blame for everything!
【Masaya】
What'd I do?!
【Misaki】
Like, if you'd made Asuka realize her potential more and stuff... Well, I guess she's already kinda getting there, but whatever.
【Misaki】
Also, if you didn't choose Mashiro, I wouldn't have had to keep coming to practice after quitting.
【Masaya】
Stop. Don't say anything else.
I'm worried about the kitchen... the death stare...
【Misaki】
Can I ask you something, Masaya? Do you think I'll ever find happiness?
【Masaya】
Why are you asking me that?! I don't know! Happiness is something you have to find for yourself.
【Misaki】
People say that phrase all the time in shows and games, don't they?
【Masaya】
Sure, but that doesn't mean you should randomly spring it on me.
This atmosphere feels surprisingly relaxed, given the subject matter and all.
【Misaki】
So, tell me, Masaya. You basically get why I quit FC, yeah?
【Masaya】
I'm not a psychic, Misaki. I can't read your mind.
【Misaki】
What do you think's more important, natural talent or hard work?
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
I saw what true talent looks like. That's what happened.
【Masaya】
......
【Misaki】
It crushed my desire and snapped my spirit right in half. Like a twig.
I think I get where she's coming from.
It's the same feeling I experienced that day... when I saw the perfectly blue sky.
Misaki felt that same sense of powerlessness. A feeling of defeat so crushing it robs you of any desire you have to still play the game.
【Misaki】
Well, that was just my misunderstanding... Turns out it's still hanging on by a tiny little thread.
【Misaki】
You know what Mashiro told me the other day? She said I had talent.
【Misaki】
...Isn't that funny?
【Masaya】
What do you think matters more, natural talent or hard work?
【Masaya】
Let me rephrase that. What do you <i>want</i> to matter more?
【Misaki】
Y'know, I'm sure I do have some talent.
【Misaki】
So if Mashiro and I fought for real, I'm willing to bet that I, the one with talent, would scrape out a win.
【Masaya】
I asked what you <i>want</i> to matter more, not what you think does.
【Misaki】
...I've never thought about it.
【Misaki】
But, honestly, if I did end up losing to her, I'd probably start questioning everything I believe in.
...True.
<i>True</i> talent is the kind of thing that makes you shudder. Winning seems physically impossible, no matter how hard you try...
That's what happened to me. That's why I quit FC, and ran away.
But if I accept that effort can beat talent, then what have I been doing with my life these past few years? I've been telling myself something that isn't true.
I have a hunch that Misaki is scared of fighting Mashiro.
If she wins, all it does it confirm her belief. Her belief that she can only go so far.
But if Mashiro wins, it invalidates her entire reason for quitting. It turns her entire belief system upside down.
And honestly, I'm in the same boat...
【Misaki】
Who would you want to win, Masaya?
She thrusts that question in front of me like a dagger against my throat.
【Masaya】
...Mashiro. I feel like that would solve everyone's problems.
【Misaki】
Hm...
The expression on her face is far too ambiguous, so I can't tell what she thinks of my answer.
【Misaki】
Well, guess I'll head on out now.
【Masaya】
Can I ask you one thing before you go?
【Masaya】
What do you think of Mashiro? Be honest.
I ask her a question that's been plaguing my mind for a long time now.
【Misaki】
Hm, I don't wanna talk about it here.
I look in the direction Misaki is, and see...
【Botan】
......
Botan-san notices Misaki looking at her and waves.
I highly doubt she was eavesdropping, but it must be hard to talk about this in the presence of Mashiro's mother.
【Masaya】
...I'll ask her to give me a moment to step outside with you.
【Misaki】
You really don't have to.
Misaki leaves the money on the table and gets up.
The fact that she opted for that instead of paying at the register feels like an indirect sign of rejection.
【Misaki】
Bye!
【Botan】
Come again.
She gives Botan-san a quick bow.
After watching her long, black hair sway as she leaves, I go to her table to clean it off when I realize something.
【Masaya】
Goddammit, Misaki...
【Masaya】
That's not enough money.
Guess I'll get what's missing when I go after her.
【Misaki】
So, you wanted to know what I thought about Mashiro, yeah?
【Masaya】
If I'm being honest, it's hard to tell if you really like her at times.
【Misaki】
She's a nice friend to have 'cause she always gives me free udon! Uh, maybe that wasn't the best way to put it?
【Masaya】
I'll just assume you're kidding.
【Misaki】
Well, can you blame me? She's super clingy.
【Masaya】
Is she really, though? The way I see it, she only goes as far as the other person's comfortable with.
【Misaki】
...I dunno.
【Masaya】
Mashiro told me about how you and her met.
【Masaya】
She said you reached out your hand to her when she was at a really depressing point in her life.
【Masaya】
She said she'll never forget the day.
【Misaki】
Did she tell you everything?
【Masaya】
...No. She didn't want to tell me without your permission.
【Misaki】
Man, she'd be a lot cuter if she just put her boyfriend first.
【Masaya】
Well, it depends on the situation. I like people who care about others instead of those who are blindly obsessed with a single person.
【Misaki】
She used to be <i>super</i> shy and reserved back then.
【Masaya】
That's what I heard.
Okoze mentioned that.
【Masaya】
I got to know her through you, so I never knew.
【Misaki】
She was so awkward that it was downright funny... Well, maybe awkward isn't the right word. She just couldn't ever speak her mind.
【Misaki】
And she'd always wear glasses, too. She played video games so much that they ruined her eyesight.
【Misaki】
Apparently she never really had anything she was good at. She never knew what it was like to win or be successful. She got used to giving up, telling herself she'd never get anywhere no matter how hard she tried.
【Misaki】
She had no confidence in herself, so she was too afraid to speak her mind. Poor girl just walked around with her eyes on the ground all the time.
【Misaki】
I was like, wow, there really <i>are</i> people with no friends whatsoever. Plus, we're in a rural area where everyone's real tight-knit and stuff, so it sucks big time when you don't have a single friend.
【Misaki】
Probably why I couldn't tell what was up with her when I first met her. I just saw this girl hugging her knees all by herself, looking at the ground and stuff.
【Misaki】
I straight-up thought she was sleeping. Then, I saw she didn't finish her lunch, and I thought man, it'd be a shame to let all that good food go to waste, so I tried sneaking in from the side... But that didn't go too well.
【Masaya】
Are you serious?
【Misaki】
Man, it's crazy to think about. How she misinterpreted that as me trying to reach out my hand to her. Big screw up on my part.
【Masaya】
Does she know about that...?
【Misaki】
I told her, but she didn't believe me. And not only that, she started bringing me udon for lunch after that.
【Misaki】
It was probably the food, honestly. I acted a <i>little</i> too nice to her when we first met.
【Masaya】
Misaki...
【Misaki】
You probably won't believe it, but I did try to turn her down, I swear. But that girl, she just kept asking me what stuff I liked. Then, the next day the udon she brought would have that in it.
【Misaki】
And hey, I'm not gonna pass up a free meal.
【Masaya】
I don't even know what to say.
【Misaki】
So that's basically what our relationship's been ever since. Free udon for meee!
【Masaya】
There's nothing even remotely heart-warming about that.
【Misaki】
Well, yeah. I was just kinda waiting for her to wake up, if you know what I mean. Which thankfully, a certain someone has taken care of.
【Masaya】
...I'm not doing that for you.
【Misaki】
Didn't say you were.
【Misaki】
Man, I just wanna disappear from the world.
【Masaya】
You know, Misaki.
【Misaki】
Hm?
【Masaya】
It seems like you're the most prone to emotional issues among us.
【Misaki】
Heh, you just never realized. I happen to be the girliest girl around you!
【Masaya】
Don't expect me to play along with your jokes.
【Misaki】
Wow, I'm serious! You big meanie!
【Misaki】
But, y'know, I'd probably be ten times more depressed if I <i>really</i> cared about Mashiro.
【Misaki】
I bet I would've done all sorts of crazy stuff to be the kind of person she thinks I am.
【Masaya】
We both know you can't just fundamentally change who you are.
【Misaki】
Yeah, probably, but you'd still try. Especially when you're around her. She'd make you think you could.
【Misaki】
I'm glad my only love is udon! Misaki-chan can live to see another day!
【Botan】
How did it go? Do you think Mashiro can make up with her?
Botan-san asks me that question as soon as I walk back into the restaurant. She probably guessed what our conversation was about.
【Masaya】
I don't know. It's something they'll have to work out between themselves. Of course, if they want my help, I'll provide it.
【Botan】
Hm...
【Masaya】
Is there something you want to say?
【Botan】
People are ever-changing. We overcome all sorts of problems life throws our way and grow stronger as a result.
【Masaya】
Isn't that a little too optimistic?
【Botan】
Maybe. But sometimes, all it takes is a bit of time to overcome an obstacle, while at other times, you also have to put in a great deal of effort...
【Botan】
You may not know, but Misaki-chan is quite perceptive.
【Masaya】
What do you mean?
【Botan】
Can you believe that she used to hate udon at one point?
【Masaya】
...What?
【Botan】
She once choked on it when she was a child. When Mashiro brought her over here for the first time, she came to me and secretly asked me to make her portion as small as I could.
【Masaya】
Does Mashiro know?
【Botan】
Nope. Misaki-chan was being nice to her, and if she chose not to tell her, then it's not my place.
【Botan】
She must've endured a lot while being friends with Mashiro. See, Mashiro actually believed she loved udon and brought her some every single day.
I can understand how Misaki must've felt. I went through a similar experience with Mashiro misunderstanding what a perfectly blue sky meant to me.
【Botan】
I really do love Misaki-chan.
Now that I think about it, the puzzle didn't quite fit together earlier.
Misaki called her clingy, and acted like she didn't care about her, but she knows so much about Mashiro's past and what she's been through.
She'd have to have <i>some</i> interest in her as a person to know her struggles.
【Masaya】
...I'll ask her to give me a moment to step outside with you.
【Misaki】
You really don't have to.
【Masaya】
Goddammit, Misaki... That's not enough money.
What if the reason she did that was so I'd chase after her?
【Misaki】
But, y'know, I'd probably be ten times more depressed if I <i>actually</i> cared about Mashiro.
【Misaki】
I bet I would've done all sorts of crazy stuff to be the kind of person she thinks I am.
【Masaya】
We both know you can't just fundamentally change who you are.
【Misaki】
Yeah, probably, but you'd still try. Especially when you're around her. She'd make you think you could.
【Misaki】
I'm glad my only love is udon! Misaki-chan can live to see another day!
What if that was Misaki's cry for help?
【Masaya】
She was right...
"Misaki-senpai never speaks her mind..."
Mashiro hit the nail on the head.
Misaki... Normally, you'd only be able to fool a naive girl like Mashiro with that.
But because of the time I've spent with Mashiro as her boyfriend, I've come to see through things...
And I'm capable of acting on that.
I think I've finally figured out how to solve this problem.
【Botan】
Oh, someone looks happy.
【Masaya】
Yeah. Ever since I started dating Mashiro, I've found myself getting giddy over the smallest things.
【Masaya】
Ah...
【Botan】
...Oh my.
Seems Mashiro's dad heard that in the kitchen, which explains the sound of a dropped plate.
【Botan】
You can go home now, Masaya-kun. I'll come up with some way to fool him, so don't you worry about that.
【Masaya】
...I apologize in advance, Botan-san.
【Botan】
Huh?
I turn in the direction of the kitchen and bow my head.
【Masaya】
I'm very sorry about that, sir! I am currently dating your daughter... Mashiro-san!
【Masaya】
I just felt so happy about that fact that it accidentally came out of my mouth!
【Masaya】
I'll come back later and have a proper conversation with you! But I have something important to take care off right now, so I'll be gone for the two weeks before the tournament as planned!
【Masaya】
I'll be leaving for today, but thank you, sir!
I actually said it.
【Botan】
Young love is just so sweet.
【Masaya】
I'll probably want to crawl in a hole later and hide from everyone, but I won't regret this.
【Botan】
Yeah, you might really end up in a hole.
【Masaya】
Um, I didn't mean it in <i>that</i> sense...
【Botan】
Well, I'll be rooting for you. Just so you know, I happen to like you a lot.
【Masaya】
Thank you.
Looks like I still don't measure up to Misaki and the years she's spent with Mashiro. That's only natural, though.
Anyway...
I need to pit Misaki and Mashiro against each other.
And to that end, I'll do everything I can.
【Masaya】
Haaah... Haaah...
【Masaya】
Ugh... Kgh...!
A few days have passed since, and it's now the weekend.
【Masaya】
There you are, Misaki. I've been looking everywhere for you.
【Misaki】
Masaya? What're you doing here on a Saturday?
【Masaya】
Just wanted to ask again if you're serious about facing Mashiro in an FC match.
【Misaki】
You were looking all over for me just for that?
【Masaya】
Well, I had to get a few things ready first.
【Misaki】
What? Wait, don't tell me you <i>actually</i> managed to get me into the tournament?
【Masaya】
Nah, that would've been impossible.
【Misaki】
I feel like you... or maybe Ms. Kagami or Shirase-san could've made something happen.
【Masaya】
Aoi-san's not that nice to me, so there's no way she'd help.
【Misaki】
Hm... This doesn't make sense, then. Why would I agree to fight her if it's not a tournament match?
【Masaya】
So, what's this I hear about how you used to hate udon?
【Misaki】
Wha--?!
【Masaya】
The reason you didn't want to talk inside the restaurant has to be because you didn't want Botan-san telling me the truth.
【Misaki】
...What, are you gonna tell Mashiro that if I don't fight her? Well, I'll give you props for catching me off-guard, but I know you're not actually gonna do that.
【Masaya】
No, I wasn't going to. Finding that out about you just made me want to push you a little harder, that's all.
【Masaya】
Let's make a bet.
【Misaki】
Uh, on what?
【Masaya】
Here's what I have in mind. We'll do a little short distance flight race, you and me. If I win, you play Mashiro. If you win, I'll treat you to any food of your choosing for a whole year.
【Misaki】
...What's the catch?
【Masaya】
You think there's a catch? Man, Misaki, that hurts.
【Misaki】
Sorry, but there's just no way you'll beat me. I don't play now, but it hasn't been <i>that</i> long, y'know?
【Misaki】
Even an idiot can see that, so the only answer is that you have some trick up your sleeve.
【Masaya】
I guess. It'll just come down to whether or not you can see through it.
【Misaki】
...What, you gonna hit me with some sob story? Like how Mashiro's <i>so</i> desperate to fight me or something?
【Masaya】
Nope.
【Misaki】
Hm... Then let me ask you this first.
【Misaki】
Do you <i>seriously</i> think you can beat me?
【Masaya】
Wouldn't be here otherwise.
【Misaki】
'Kay.
【Misaki】
...You've piqued my interest.
A grin forms on her face.
【Misaki】
I dunno what you have in mind, but I'll power through any of your gimmicks...
【Misaki】
That's the stuff that gets me pumped!
【Masaya】
So you're game?
【Misaki】
I owe that much to Botan-san. She's the one who told you I used to not like udon, right?
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Misaki】
I don't mind her telling you, since that means she thought you should know, but that means I won't hold back.
We move up into the sky.
【Misaki】
So, what distance we racing?
【Masaya】
Let's see...
I look around... and spot a balloon that someone must've let go of, ascending.
【Masaya】
Once that balloon's reaches our altitude, we'll race to see who gets to it first. How about that?
【Misaki】
Oh, that's pretty short. Won't take more than seven or eight seconds for me. Guess that means your trick is a one-and-done deal, huh?
【Masaya】
Who knows? You'll have to wait and see.
【Misaki】
Fine... Just know that I'm going all out.
Those are the last words we exchange.
The only sound now is the wind blowing past me.
In sharp contrast to that silence, my heart is beating like a drum.
A few unnaturally long seconds go by as we wait for the balloon to reach our altitude. Then...
【Masaya】
Okay!
【Misaki】
Go!
We both speed off without a moment's delay.
【Misaki】
Let me see what you've got up your-- Huh?
I ignore her. Instead, I accelerate to insane speeds, leaving her in the dust.
This is a handy technique I mastered when I was younger. It allows you to accelerate beyond the limits of your Grav Shoes, and it's what helped me compete against world class Skywalkers.
After years upon years of not using it, I've finally decided to bust it out to help someone other than myself.
【Misaki】
No way...
She's finally caught on.
I'm the one who's relying on sheer power and speed.
The growing difference in distance makes her tilt forward in an attempt to accelerate.
【Misaki】
Kgh...!
But Misaki is a Fighter, so she can't possibly reach her top speed that fast, and especially not in the two seconds it'll take me to reach the balloon.
And a few moments later...
【Masaya】
...Got it!
I catch the balloon as the wind pressure from my flight pushes it away.
Meaning our little match that took less than ten seconds has now concluded with my victory.
Misaki flies up to me.
【Misaki】
You <i>really did</i> pull something!
She's furious.
【Masaya】
Hey, I told you I would... Ugh...
【Misaki】
How'd you manage to go that fast?! It makes no sense at all. What were you doing these past-- Masaya?
【Masaya】
Ugh... Ughhh...
【Misaki】
Hey, Masaya! Why are you gagging?! Are you okay?!
【Masaya】
...I'm fine. I came here on an empty stomach, so I should be able to hold it in.
【Misaki】
What's this about?
【Masaya】
...I guess that trauma's still with me. I thought I got rid of the pain, but all I really did was paint over it.
【Misaki】
What are you talking about?! Explain!
【Masaya】
...This is what happens when I fly seriously. I never knew until I tried the other day and it turned out like this.
It was so awful that I don't even want to remember it.
My whole body was shaking and I was sweating bullets.
【Masaya】
But I practiced for a few days, and now I'm at the point where I can hold up for ten seconds. After that, well, you can see for yourself what happens.
【Misaki】
God, I can't believe you can say that with a smile on your face. Why would you even do all that to yourself...?
【Masaya】
For Mashiro. So she can get the chance to fight you.
【Masaya】
I'll be siding with her, since I want her to win.
【Misaki】
So you're choosing hard work over talent?
【Masaya】
Yeah, that's right. I have to. It won't work unless I 100% believe that.
【Misaki】
Stuff like that weirds me out...
【Masaya】
I don't blame you, but it's something I have to do.
【Masaya】
So, yeah. I won our little bet, and you know what that means.
【Asuka】
Oh, Masaya-san.
【Masaya】
You're joining them now, Asuka? Nice.
【Asuka】
Yeah, they were nice enough to let me.
Asuka seems to have joined the ever growing Speeder Alliance.
It's not even really a Speeder Alliance at this point, though...
【Arika】
You've barely showed up to any of our practices these past two weeks, Hinata-senpai. What's up with that?
【Masaya】
Sorry, I was busy with some stuff. Didn't I give Ichinose the practice schedule and detailed instructions on what everyone needs to work on, though?
【Rika】
You did! It really came in handy.
【Masaya】
Glad to hear... Anyway...
【Arika】
Oh, wondering why we're wearing the suits?
【Masaya】
Not particularly...
【Arika】
The tournament's coming up soon, so we decided to get some practice matches in.
【Masaya】
That's a good idea.
I already kinda assumed that when I saw them in their suits.
【Masaya】
I was going to ask you about something else, though...
【Arika】
We did a mini round-robin practice tournament with the four of us. Wanna know the results?
【Masaya】
Sure, go ahead. Can't make excuses if nobody was playing with a second...
【Rika】
Asuka-san came out on top. I have to say, she really is something special.
【Asuka】
That's not true. They were all really close matches.
【Arika】
I got beat to a pulp by Rika.
【Rika】
You're exaggerating.
【Masaya】
...You're doing this to me on purpose, aren't you?
I look at them in exasperation.
【Rika】
Hehe... You figured it out?
【Masaya】
At least apologize or something.
Basically, they're teasing me by specifically dragging out these conversations to keep me from asking where Mashiro is.
【Masaya】
So, where's Mashiro?
【Arika】
Doing some special training.
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Rika】
Unfortunately, she came in last place.
【Masaya】
I see...
So she lost and left to practice on her own.
【Asuka】
...Ah!
【Masaya】
Was Mashiro at least smiling...?
【Rika】
She was! She said she'd beat us all next time.
【Arika】
Yeah. It was kind of weird how fired up she was...
【Asuka】
M-Masaya-san, is she...?!
【Masaya】
It's fine. I'll go.
I need to go.
【Mashiro】
Hic... Hic...
【Masaya】
...Guess I let you down again. Sorry, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
S-Senpai...?
【Mashiro】
I-I'm sorry, I'll stop crying.
【Masaya】
You can cry, that's fine. Let it all out until you feel better.
I place my hand on her head and stroke it.
【Masaya】
So, what's going on?
【Mashiro】
I ran my mouth to you about how I wanted to beat Misaki-senpai, but I suck. I'm nowhere near her level.
【Mashiro】
Everyone else is focused on the tournament, but I'm focused on something completely different.
【Mashiro】
I feel like all my hard work's going to waste...
【Masaya】
I see.
Mashiro's been agonizing about these things this whole time.
To the point where, eventually, she couldn't contain her emotions in that tiny body of hers and it all burst out.
【Masaya】
I feel really bad when you go off like this and cry all by yourself, Mashiro. At least come to me, okay?
【Mashiro】
You've seemed busy lately, though.
【Masaya】
I told you I had a little something to take care of, didn't I?
【Mashiro】
Yeah, but you didn't tell me what.
【Masaya】
Right. Sorry about that.
I couldn't tell her I was practicing flying.
I didn't want her to see me all shaken up like I was. I guess you could just chalk it up to a silly matter of pride.
【Mashiro】
Part of me was afraid... that you just didn't care about me anymore...
【Mashiro】
I tried not to think about it... and I kept telling myself over and over that you'd never change like that, but still...
【Masaya】
Silly. Of course I care about you.
【Mashiro】
I know. I know, but...
Man, hearing that really makes my heart ache.
【Masaya】
Sorry for leaving you alone when you were feeling down and lonely... But I managed to accomplish it, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
What exactly?
【Masaya】
I talked to Misaki. She said she'll go back to playing FC if you can beat her.
【Mashiro】
What...?
【Masaya】
The match'll be next weekend on a Saturday. Coincidentally, the day before the tournament.
【Mashiro】
How... How did you convince her...?
【Masaya】
I'm your coach, Mashiro. I'll make anything happen if it's for one of my players.
【Mashiro】
I'm sorry... You did all that, but I honestly don't think I stand a chance.
【Masaya】
You have me.
【Mashiro】
I'd love to believe I can win. I really would, but come on...
【Masaya】
Remember our two promises?
【Masaya】
I told you I'd help you win, and I told you I'd get Misaki to return.
【Masaya】
We'll knock both of them out with this one match.
【Mashiro】
But what if I lose...? What'll happen to our relationship with Misaki-senpai?
【Mashiro】
I'm scared... I'm really, <i>really</i> scared...
I extend my hand toward Mashiro.
Just like she extended hers to me when I was feeling down. And...
【Masaya】
It's your turn to hold out a hand to Misaki.
【Mashiro】
Huh...?
【Masaya】
You took Misaki's hand when you first met, remember?
【Masaya】
So now it's your turn to repay her. I'll be holding your hand tight, so make sure you grab hold of hers.
【Mashiro】
Senpai, how do you...?
【Masaya】
We're gonna win, Mashiro. That's the only way we can take Misaki's hand.
Mashiro stares at my hand for a few seconds, seeming somewhat afraid, but then...
【Mashiro】
Help me beat Misaki-senpai.
She firmly grasps my hand.
【Masaya】
Mashiro.
I once again see an iron-clad will in those tear-stained eyes of hers.
【Masaya】
Let's win this together.
Mashiro gives me a silent nod in response.
One week has passed, and it's now the day of Mashiro's match with Misaki.
【Masaya】
Okay. I'll be Mashiro's second, and for you, Misaki... You're <i>really</i> sure you don't want one?
【Misaki】
Yep, I'm good.
【Asuka】
Do you want me to be your second?
【Misaki】
Hm, I appreciate the thought, but nah. This match is different.
【Asuka】
Okay. I'll at least track Mashiro-chan's position and things like that for you.
【Misaki】
Thanks, I'll take you up on that... Apart from that, are we gonna go without a ref? I mean, there's no real need if we're all gonna follow the rules, but...
【Mashiro】
...Sounds good to me. I'm ready to get this going whenever you are.
【Misaki】
Aight! Ready furr liftoff!
Misaki casually floats off toward first.
【Masaya】
You've got this in the bag, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Thanks! Time to fly meowt!
Mashiro shouts her activation key and takes off.
I look at Asuka.
【Masaya】
Sorry. I know you'd rather be practicing for the tournament right now.
【Asuka】
...You don't have to be sorry. I know how important this match is.
【Masaya】
...Thanks.
She's friends with all of us, so she understands what's on the line.
In a sense, this match is like the final showdown.
【Asuka】
I hope it solves everything for everyone.
【Masaya】
...Me too.
That's the very reason we threw down the gauntlet at Misaki.
I narrow my eyes, then look up at the playing field.
【Mashiro】
Here's to a good match.
【Misaki】
Sure thing.
【Mashiro】
You better not go easy on me, okay?
【Misaki】
Sure, I can do that. But I'm nothing that special even at my best, y'know?
【Mashiro】
Oh, but you are. I know exactly what you're capable of when you're trying.
【Misaki】
...Yeah, I dunno about that. Well, enough chitchat. Let's get this match started.
【Mashiro】
Ready when you are.
Misaki waves her hand down below.
【Misaki】
Masayaaa! Give us the signal so we can start!
【Masaya】
Can I ask you to do that, Asuka?
【Asuka】
Huh? You want me to? Sure, I guess I can...! O-Okay, I'm about to start the match! Is everyone ready?
【Misaki】
Totally!
【Mashiro】
Same here.
【Asuka】
Ready, set...
【Misaki】
......
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
Misaki seems completely relaxed, while it's clear how nervous Mashiro is.
【Asuka】
Pheeeeeeeeeeee!
The moment Asuka mimics the sound of a whistle, the two of them propel their bodies past the starting line.
【Misaki】
'Kay. I'll be waiting on the second line. Take your time.
With a wave of the hand, Misaki jumps to second.
【Masaya】
...Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Yeah.
【Masaya】
Don't fall for her tricks. She could just be acting like that so she can catch you off-guard and take control of the match.
【Mashiro】
I don't think so. This is just her being her usual self.
【Masaya】
...Yeah, could be.
【Mashiro】
I doubt that she's legitimately scared of me. If anything, I feel like jumping to the next line was just the natural option for her, so she did it without really thinking.
【Masaya】
What makes you think that?
【Mashiro】
I mean, there's no way she recognizes me as a threat, so why would she intentionally need to deceive me? She can beat me head-on.
【Masaya】
That might be true, but you always want to consider the possibility.
【Mashiro】
...Why's that?
【Masaya】
If you corner yourself into thinking that way, you'll get careless.
【Mashiro】
So she'll catch me sleeping, basically?
【Masaya】
That's the right idea. If that's part of her strategy, you've already fallen right for it.
【Mashiro】
Why would she use such an elaborate strategy against someone like me...?
【Masaya】
I'm just proposing hypotheticals. If it <i>were</i> her strategy, she'd have you right where she wants you now. And that's not good.
【Mashiro】
...True.
【Masaya】
If you take her too lightly, you'll regret it later. Sharpen your focus and be on guard for anything she might be doing.
【Mashiro】
You're right... Maybe I got a little too relaxed knowing she was my opponent. I'm focusing now! Let's do this!
【Masaya】
That's the spirit! You remember the strategy, right? Rush her down and mix in some feints! But be careful so she doesn't catch you.
【Mashiro】
Roger!
Mashiro speeds forward and touches second.
The score is now 1:0.
Using the repulsion from it, she speeds up while making a gradual ascent.
Here we go.
Mashiro is a Speeder, while Misaki is a Fighter.
In the Speeder-Fighter matchup, it's extremely common for whoever takes the momentum first to win the match.
Will the Speeder break through and circle around the buoys, or will the Fighter stop them?
The outcome of this match could very well be decided in the next minute or so.
After Mashiro reaches a certain altitude, she levels off and proceeds to fly horizontally.
【Mashiro】
......
Our plan is for her to make use of gravity to swoop down at high speeds toward the midway point between Misaki and third.
She's not making a straight shot for it because that's a beginner's move. Any good opponent would see through that.
We don't want Misaki to stop Mashiro while she's still gaining speed.
As long as there's enough distance between her and third, Mashiro has the ability to adjust her flight based on what action Misaki takes.
If Misaki decides to head to third and guard it, all Mashiro has to do is fly at her, full speed. She'll not only knock Misaki away, but be able to touch third after.
A collision like that will allow Mashiro to preserve her forward momentum, since repulsion is relative.
That's why the one trying to prevent the other from reaching a buoy never stands directly in front of it.
【Misaki】
Here we go...
Misaki takes up her position, then casually stops in Mashiro's path.
【Misaki】
Haaah...
She heaves a heavy sigh, then looks up at Mashiro.
What's she thinking?
Fighters do have high initial velocity, but just floating there won't help her win.
【Masaya】
......
It's a breach of etiquette, in my opinion, but I push that thought aside and glance over to Asuka.
【Asuka】
Misaki-chan, what's wrong? Do you not feel well? Is it a tummyache?
I can tell Asuka's panicking right now.
【Misaki】
......
Misaki, on the other hand, just maintains that nonchalant look on her face.
Does she have some plan?
【Masaya】
Mashiro, stay focused!
【Mashiro】
I know!
【Misaki】
......
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
She zooms forward, making use of feints by looking in directions other than her trajectory and twitching her shoulders to confuse Misaki about if she's going left or right.
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
After initially leaning her body to the left, Mashiro does a sharp right lean and dashes past Misaki.
Misaki just floats there with a smile on her face.
【Misaki】
So that's your game plan, huh?
【Mashiro】
...What?
【Misaki】
......
Misaki follows Mashiro with her eyes, but doesn't move in any other way.
【Misaki】
Onto the next one.
After getting visual confirmation that Mashiro's about to make contact with third, Misaki shoots off toward the next line.
【Mashiro】
...Senpai.
The anxious tone in her voice echoes through my ears.
【Mashiro】
What's she thinking? She was just floating there...
【Masaya】
No idea, but don't let your guard down.
【Mashiro】
I know, I won't... But is she just going to throw the match on purpose?
【Masaya】
Then score a hundred points! That'll be enough to wake her up.
【Mashiro】
...Yeah. You're right! Let's do this!
【Masaya】
Keep flying, Mashiro!
【Mashiro】
Roger!
Mashiro touches third and accelerates down the next line.
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
Once again, Misaki's just floating in place.
Seriously, what the hell's her gameplan?
【Mashiro】
Coming through!
Mashiro uses the same feints with her eyes and shoulders while flying fast at a sharp angle, diagonally upward toward Misaki.
【Misaki】
......
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
And Mashiro easily evades her.
Misaki does the same thing as last time. She doesn't follow Mashiro, and instead jumps to the next line.
【Mashiro】
I don't care what Misaki-senpai's up to! I'll score a hundred points and show her!
【Masaya】
That's the spirit!
What's Misaki trying to pull here?
Now she's just floating around on the fourth line.
Is she seriously not even going to <i>try</i> to win?
Mashiro's keeping her motivation high by aiming to score a hundred points, but...
Is this really how she wants to win her match against Misaki?
Is Misaki doing this to hurt her?
No, I know her. She's not like that.
Ah!
【Masaya】
Misaki definitely has a trick up her sleeve, Mashiro... She's not throwing this match.
【Mashiro】
Did you figure something out?
【Masaya】
Just trust me. Be ready for anything.
【Mashiro】
Got it.
That's 3:0.
【Misaki】
......
As for Misaki--
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Mashiro】
...Ah!
She's starting to circle around in a horizontal loop. This can only mean one thing. She's getting ready to intercept Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Misaki-senpai!
Mashiro shouts out in zealous glee.
Misaki simply beckons for her.
【Misaki】
Come play with me, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
G-Got it!
【Masaya】
Stay calm!
【Mashiro】
I know!
...I sure hope she does.
Following a steep climb, Mashiro dives down.
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
【Misaki】
Heh...!
Misaki reacts and starts moving around in search of the best position for her to successfully intercept Mashiro.
She isn't going to find it easily, I know.
【Mashiro】
...Take this!
Mashiro makes several feints involving her line of sight and upper body. In addition, she also rocks left and right at irregular paces.
【Mashiro】
There!
Right when she pretends like she's about to choose a direction, she'll also throw in those shouts to throw Misaki off-guard.
If you're paying enough attention, just those shouts might make you instinctively move.
Mashiro is using everything in her arsenal to fool Misaki.
Misaki once told Mashiro that she wasn't good at dealing with feints, which is why she's been working thoroughly on her feints during practice.
【Mashiro】
......
You'd be hard-pressed to find a Skywalker who doesn't have trouble with these feints. The more you try to read her actions, the more confused you get. Or at least, that's how it should be.
But Misaki is quick to react.
【Misaki】
Whoosh!
Misaki stands in an upright position, then throws her arms up like she's swimming. This motion is the initial windup that precedes a rapid climb.
【Mashiro】
Huh...?!
Mashiro reacts instantaneously and dives downward at a much sharper angle.
【Mashiro】
I got past you!
Something flickers through the back of my head for a moment.
【Masaya】
Careful!
【Mashiro】
Huh?
I've seen this exact situation in a match before.
【Misaki】
Got you!
Misaki does a vertical, 180 degree roll and shoots toward Mashiro from directly above her.
【Misaki】
You're mine!
Mashiro's back is wide open, and Misaki's hand is closing in fast.
【Mashiro】
What?! Aaaaaah!
Mashiro was convinced that she'd already escaped her clutches, so the unexpected touch makes her completely lose balance.
【Misaki】
One more!
After Misaki recovers from the upward force of the repulsion, she dives down toward Mashiro's back again, taking advantage of the fact that she's still struggling to regain her balance.
【Mashiro】
Eeek!
She's successfully scored another point.
This puts things at 3:2.
【Mashiro】
Aaah! Eeek! Wait, how did she get me like that?
【Masaya】
Fly in wide arcs to ramp up speed, then head diagonally downward!
【Mashiro】
O-Okay!
That was the exact same thing she did to Ichinose in the summer tournament.
She was hesitant to fly after Ichinose back during that match, but now, she's going right after Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
【Misaki】
You're not going anywhere!
【Mashiro】
I'm not stopping for you! And I thought you said you were bad at dealing with feints?!
【Misaki】
You think I'd tell you the truth? Come on now.
【Mashiro】
Ugh...!
Mashiro has gained a considerable amount of speed.
Any average Fighter would've been too dissuaded by her speed to give chase, but not Misaki. Whenever Mashiro flies in an arc, she flies in smaller ones, predicting where Mashiro will go, and taking the shortest path there.
Man, she's really something else.
【Misaki】
See you later!
【Mashiro】
Huh?
Suddenly, after sticking to Mashiro's heels for the past minute or so, Misaki pulls away.
She's heading straight for first.
【Misaki】
......
【Misaki】
Score!
She touches the buoy and scores her third point.
The score is now 3:3. I still can't believe she just evened the score like it was nothing.
She was keeping track of her own position relative to the field while putting pressure on Mashiro... That's insane.
【Mashiro】
No way...
【Masaya】
Get it together, Mashiro! It's not over yet!
【Mashiro】
She basically gave me those first three points for free, so the score may as well be 0:3.
【Masaya】
That's not true. She didn't just give you those points for free. She was sacrificing those points so she could get data. Stop worrying about that and jump to the first line before she touches second!
【Mashiro】
Huh?
【Masaya】
Come on, aren't you paying attention?! She just touched first, so her plan is to go for the next one! Don't let that little setback shake you up! We've still got this!
【Mashiro】
Roger!
【Masaya】
Losing isn't an option, Mashiro!
【Mashiro】
Yeah, we have to win this!
She jumps to the first line and assumes position near the second half of it. If she went to the center of it, she wouldn't have had time to prepare before Misaki reached her.
【Misaki】
......
By the time Mashiro reaches the line, Misaki is already beyond the midway point.
【Masaya】
Don't wait. Fly toward her.
【Mashiro】
Roger!
Mashiro isn't allowed to go for second until she either makes contact with Misaki or their paths cross.
Speeders generally prefer more distance between them and their opponent, so a situation like this where they <i>have</i> to approach them isn't ideal.
After she realizes that Mashiro is coming at her, Misaki raises her upper body to assume an upright position.
【Misaki】
C'mere. I'll wait patiently.
【Masaya】
Don't take her bait, Mashiro. She's trying to drag you into a dogfight.
【Mashiro】
That's good to hear!
【Masaya】
How?
【Mashiro】
The fact that she's trying to provoke me means she's taking this seriously. She'd only do something like if she <i>wanted</i> to win, right?
【Masaya】
I guess you've somehow managed to ignite the fire in her.
Someone who didn't care to win would never outright provoke their opponent.
【Masaya】
Still, you don't want to play her game. Don't take the bait.
【Mashiro】
I know that!
【Masaya】
Fly until you reach her horizontal position, then make a U-turn and shoot for second. Whatever you do, don't let her get close to you.
【Mashiro】
Got it!
She only has to reach Misaki's position horizontally. Vertical distance doesn't matter.
Once she does that, she can legally score by touching the next buoy.
What she needs to do now is close the distance horizontally while maintaining a sizable vertical distance between them. If she does that, she won't get roped into a dogfight.
【Misaki】
Hey, you know more about dogfights than most Speeders. Give it a shot.
【Mashiro】
......
Mashiro ignores her provocation and inches closer.
【Misaki】
Well, if you wanna makes this boring, I can do that too.
【Mashiro】
Huh?
【Misaki】
I'll just head for second!
Misaki accelerates toward the next buoy.
【Mashiro】
What?
Since Mashiro was flying in the opposite direction, Misaki passes her in no time.
【Masaya】
After her!
【Mashiro】
Roger!
Dammit, this is bad!
Mashiro comes to a stop, turns around, and flies after Misaki in hot pursuit.
The better play was obviously to turn around using a wide U-turn, since that would let her maintain speed.
【Masaya】
Calm down, Mashiro!
【Mashiro】
I am!
"If you were calm, you wouldn't have made such a rookie mistake!" I almost feel like shouting at her, but that won't accomplish anything.
【Masaya】
Don't jump to the next line, Mashiro! Don't worry about her touching second, just keep chasing her! If you use your advantages, you can definitely catch up!
【Mashiro】
Okay!
【Misaki】
Catch me if you can, Mashiro!
Misaki touches second, bringing the score to 3:4.
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
Misaki is now flying down the second line while Mashiro chases her.
Then, presumably having figured out that Mashiro will eventually catch up, Misaki stops and starts circling in a small loop.
【Misaki】
C'mon, Mashiro, let's play. You've kept me waiting long enough.
【Mashiro】
Not a chance! I'm flying past you, whether you like it or not.
Mashiro once again makes use of her feints.
【Misaki】
Whoops!
Misaki moves to the side.
Perfect! She can get past her now!
But the moment I think we have it in the bag, Misaki moves to the opposite side.
【Misaki】
Gotcha!
【Mashiro】
Ngh!
That makes it 3:5 now.
【Masaya】
Fly in a wide arc and shake her off with your speed!
If Mashiro doesn't put some distance between them fast, Misaki's just going to keep scoring more and more!
【Mashiro】
Haaah... Haaah... Haaah...
She's panting hard.
Dammit, this is just like the first time!
There's nothing more stressful than falling for the same trap twice. And that only speeds up the process of physical exhaustion.
You feel helpless, like your opponent is always one step ahead of you. I've experienced this feeling myself.
I can feel some section of my head burning up. It stings almost like poison.
An image flashes through my mind. The day I quit... the day I turned my back on FC.
The memories of that summer day come flooding in.
What was once fun became stressful. Everything I did from that point onward was out of a fear of someone overtaking me.
And when that day soon came, I had a mental breakdown.
I could no longer play FC.
Mashiro...
Will she still be able to keep playing after being utterly dismantled by a player she vowed to beat?
I almost believe it'd be easier for her just to quit.
Those thoughts swarm my mind.
If I was playing, I probably would've given up on this match.
【Masaya】
Ah...!
My vision is blurred blue.
It's all coming back to me. The perfectly blue sky.
The blurred image of my tears and the overwhelming pain and resignation I felt.
Back then, I was too dumbfounded to even move or realize what had just happened.
But...!
【Masaya】
You're not gonna give up yet, are you?
I wipe away the cloud of blue and find Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
Don't ask me a question with such an obvious answer! Why are you trying to test my resolve at a time like this?! I'm desperately trying to focus here, okay?!
Right. Fighting until the last breath is the only option in Mashiro's mind.
She's a million times stronger than I ever was. And I couldn't be more proud of her for that.
That's why I can't run away.
I have a job to do as her second. I have keep trying to get her the win until the bitter end... No, I <i>will</i> get her the win!
【Masaya】
Okay, so she's going after you right now, but at some point she'll stop and go for third. When she does that, chase her and make sure to maintain your speed this time.
【Mashiro】
Okay!
I'd much rather just have Mashiro shoot for third, but that's not possible.
Misaki's easily in control of this match right now.
If I make Mashiro go for third, Misaki will probably just stall her and swipe her for another point, since she has the positional advantage at the moment.
And if that isn't bad enough, she'll probably be able to make a run for a third and score again.
It won't matter how strong Mashiro is. If that happens to her now, with the clock ticking down, she'll lose all her desire to keep going.
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
【Misaki】
......
Mashiro...
I can tell her stamina's slowly chipping away the more Misaki follows her.
So why doesn't Misaki just break away and go for third like she did last time?
...Ah!
This is essentially the same thing I was making her do against Ichinose at the summer tournament.
Back then, Ichinose couldn't do anything because Misaki kept circling around her, and that's how she won.
This time, her plan is to continually apply pressure on Mashiro by tailing her, which will whittle down her energy.
...I'm honestly impressed she came up with this.
I remember something I told her during her match against Ichinose.
"If you really wanna win, do whatever it takes."
I look up at her.
【Misaki】
......
I guess she really is going all out...
A chill runs down my spine.
Normally it would be the Fighter, Misaki, who has the disadvantage in this situation.
But her technical skill surpasses Mashiro's, which allows her to make up for that weakness.
The biggest issue here is the amount of stress she's applying to Mashiro.
It's mentally exhausting when someone chases you, right on your heels, for such a long period of time.
She may have me to tell her what to do, but she can't actually see her opponent. She doesn't know what might come her way and when.
Playing completely in the dark...
There's nothing more frightening.
It's hard to deal with any potential attack, and since you can't see what's coming, you only imagine the worst.
【Masaya】
Don't think about anything other than shaking her off, okay?
【Mashiro】
Okay!
Her reply may have sounded energetic, but there's no way she can just not think about it.
【Mashiro】
Here I go!
【Misaki】
...Huh?
【Masaya】
...Huh?
I know she has to be exhausted both mentally and physically, but she suddenly accelerates hard.
【Masaya】
Are you sure you can do this?
【Mashiro】
What? You just told me to shake her off!
【Masaya】
R-Right! Shake her off!
【Mashiro】
Got it!
Even though Mashiro's cranked up her speed, Misaki follows right behind.
【Misaki】
Kgh!
I guess even she's getting tired at this point.
【Misaki】
Hey, Mashiro.
Mashiro's mic picks up Misaki's voice.
【Mashiro】
What is it?
【Misaki】
Why not just give up? It's not like you have any chance of winning. Just spare yourself the pointless struggle.
Mashiro just smiles in response.
【Mashiro】
You never say what's truly on your mind.
【Misaki】
Hm? What're you talking about?
【Mashiro】
What you actually mean is that giving up now would be more painful than anything.
【Misaki】
No. I'm telling you to just give up.
【Mashiro】
Oh, Misaki-senpai. You just can't be honest with yourself.
【Misaki】
I never say anything if I don't mean it!
Suddenly, she raises her voice in anger.
【Mashiro】
......
【Misaki】
Hard work doesn't have shit on natural talent. I can only climb so high, no matter how hard I try! Don't you understand that, Mashiro? You should know <i>exactly</i> how that feels!
【Mashiro】
...But it's so much fun!
【Misaki】
What is?
【Mashiro】
Working hard toward a goal! Who cares about natural talent? I don't need that! I'm having the time of my life out here!
【Misaki】
What's so fun about losing?!
【Mashiro】
Everything! I'm only playing FC because I have so much fun out here!
Mashiro starts a Scissors while maintaining her speed.
【Misaki】
Huh? Ah! Ahhhhhh!
Misaki, who's still flying in a straight line, is quickly forced ahead of Mashiro.
【Masaya】
Go, Mashiro!
【Mashiro】
I know!
She breaks off her swerving, then flies toward Misaki and reaches out her hand.
【Mashiro】
Got you!
【Misaki】
Huh?!
That brings the score to 4:5.
【Masaya】
Go for third! Fly as fast as you can and don't look back!
【Mashiro】
Got it!
【Misaki】
What the hell?!
Mashiro utilizes the force of repulsion from the touch to twist her body and jet off in the direction of third.
【Misaki】
Ah...!
Misaki tries to give chase, but Mashiro's going too fast. She won't be able to catch up in time to prevent her from touching third.
She leans forward to accelerate down the third line.
【Mashiro】
Score!
Mashiro touches third, tying the score up at 5:5.
Man, and here I thought this match was done for...
You're doing it, Mashiro!
【Mashiro】
Haaah... Haaah... Haaah... Haaah...
【Masaya】
Only one minute left on the clock, Mashiro. Whatever happens on this line decides the game.
【Mashiro】
Haaah... Haaah... Haaah... Ngh! Good to know!
【Masaya】
Have you figured out how she got through your feints twice?
【Mashiro】
No, I haven't.
【Masaya】
Misaki's tricking you into thinking she's falling for them.
【Mashiro】
Huh?
【Masaya】
Her strategy is to make it seem like she's doing what you want her to, then she'll quickly move the opposite direction. You're the one falling for <i>her</i> feints.
【Mashiro】
...It seems so obvious now that you've pointed it out to me.
【Masaya】
So that's why I want you to go one step beyond this time.
【Mashiro】
One step beyond... Got it! I'll give it a shot!
【Masaya】
Go get her, Mashiro!
Whoever scores on this line will probably win the match.
I gaze up at Mashiro's position with bated breath.
You've got this!
I believe in her.
【Misaki】
......
Misaki's circling around the center of the third line, visibly exhausted.
【Misaki】
Just so you know, I'm not about to lose.
【Mashiro】
Same here! I'm going to beat you no matter what!
【Misaki】
Man, <i>no matter what,</i> huh...? I wish I could be that determined.
【Mashiro】
It's not too late! Ready or not, here I come!
Mashiro rushes toward her, throwing feint after feint.
【Misaki】
Ack!
Misaki moved her body sideways like she fell for one of the feints.
Remember, Mashiro! The opposite!
But even as those words enter my mind, I can't voice them to her. She only has a split second to make the right decision, so they won't reach her in time.
【Mashiro】
Kgh!
Mashiro clenches her back muscles to lift her upper body, assume an upright position, and sharply brake. Following that, she flies straight to the spot Misaki blocked.
【Misaki】
What?!
But Misaki's no longer there.
She only pretends to fall for the feint, meaning she'll move in a way that catches Mashiro off-guard to give herself the upper hand.
Which means Misaki <i>definitely</i> won't be in the original spot she had blocked off.
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
【Misaki】
Kgh!
Misaki tries to force herself back to her original position and touch Mashiro's leg. Her gameplan is to throw her off-balance with that and force a dogfight.
【Mashiro】
Ah!
Luckily, Mashiro brings her legs in and successfully manages to evade Misaki's grab.
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
But that results in a slight loss of balance. Her speed drops and she falls diagonally downward.
【Masaya】
Mashiro!
【Mashiro】
I'm going to win!
After regaining her balance, Mashiro's flies a small arc as she shoots for third.
【Misaki】
Not if I have anything to say about it!
Misaki's flying right above the line.
Mashiro has the speed, but Misaki is closer.
Mashiro's closer now!
She has this!
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
But the moment her hand reaches for third...
【Mashiro】
No way!
【Misaki】
Not yet!
Misaki touches Mashiro's ankle from below and pushes her upward.
And that, unfortunately, makes Mashiro somersault away from the buoy.
While the force of repulsion throws Misaki downward.
【Misaki】
Kgh! This is mine...!
After recovering her balance, Misaki reaches up for the buoy.
【Masaya】
Now, Mashiro!
Mashiro, however, stops tumbling and curls up, straightening her body again.
The move she's about to unleash is a beautiful, yet mysterious quick-turn that makes it seem like the player is kicking off the air.
This technique is only possible because of the unique properties of the membrane.
The legendary Airkick Turn.
【Mashiro】
I'm ON ITTTTTTTTT!
【Mashiro/Misaki】
Ah...!
【Mashiro】
Ah...!
【Misaki】
Ah...!
They touched the buoy at near identical times.
But... Mashiro was faster. The final score is 6:5.
【Asuka】
Mashiro-chan won! That was so amazing!
Asuka's in awe of what she just witnessed.
Misaki softly lands on the sand.
【Masaya】
Misaki...
【Misaki】
KGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Misaki】
I HAAAAAAAAAAAATE THIIIIIIIIIIIIS!
【Masaya】
What?!
【Asuka】
M-Misaki-chan?!
【Misaki】
I can't stand this! I can't stand this!
After stomping the sand as hard as she can for a few seconds, she calms down.
【Misaki】
Haaah... Haaah... Haaah... Masaya.
【Masaya】
Yeah?
【Misaki】
Hahaha... Losing sucks. Guess I still had a bit of competitive spirit left in me, huh?
【Masaya】
...So, what now? Are you going to keep playing FC?
【Misaki】
Good question... Well, I got hit with a miracle today, so I guess I will.
【Masaya】
Don't call it a... Oh.
【Asuka】
Mashiro-chan.
【Masaya】
Mashiro...
She just now lands.
Her feet totter as she walks. I don't know if she's just that exhausted, or if she's still in disbelief that she actually managed to clutch out a win.
The urge to give her a hug washes over me for a moment... but I quickly use my better judgement.
Her eyes are focused on another person right now.
【Misaki】
Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
......
With wobbly steps, Mashiro reaches out her hand.
And that hand clasps Misaki's.
【Mashiro】
I finally caught you, Misaki-senpai...
【Misaki】
...Yep, you sure did.
Instead, Misaki is the one who now embraces Mashiro.
I look up toward the sky without even thinking about it.
It's a beautiful, clear blue from horizon to horizon.
Their quiet sobs are drowned out by the sound of the waves.
It's after school now.
This is just another day of practice for our FC club.
【Madoka】
Gather around, everybody!
Well, maybe not. Some things have changed.
【Madoka】
The fall tournament may be behind us, but we in the Kunahama FC Club have more work to do! Now, pledge alliance to your new president, Madoka Aoyagi, and all things good will come your way!
【Misaki】
Why do you sound like a cult leader?
【Madoka】
Shut up, quitter!
【Misaki】
Don't call me that!
The first thing worth noting is that Madoka is our new club president. Well, I <i>made</i> her take the position from me.
Seeing how she's the most spirited person on our team, I think she's a good fit.
As for why I relinquished my position... Well, that's because I've decided to try something new.
I'm still the coach, but now I'm also...
【Mashiro】
Let's hope you can manage 20 seconds at full speed today, Senpai! And don't worry, I'll hold your hand along the way!
【Masaya】
Don't forget, I'm still the coach here.
【Mashiro】
Well, as a player, I have the longer standing!
That smug line's kinda adorable.
But she's right, so all I can do is nod reluctantly.
You heard right. I'm now training as a player myself, and hopefully I'll even compete in the next tournament...
【Misaki】
No need to be so shy, Masaya. Here, I'll teach you everything you need to know.
【Masaya】
M-Misaki?!
【Mashiro】
Misaki-senpai!
【Misaki】
Come on, Masaya! Let's go somewhere quiet, away from all their prying eyes. I'll give you an extra-special <i>private</i> lesson there.
【Masaya】
M-Misaki! Quit blowing into my ear!
【Mashiro】
You've been acting weird lately, Misaki-senpai.
【Misaki】
Well, I just kinda realized something.
【Masaya】
And what's that?
【Misaki】
I'll basically be set for life if I can make you mine.
【Masaya】
What?!
【Misaki】
Come on, Masaya! We can practice some High Yo-Yos, some Low Yo-Yos, and even kissing!
【Masaya】
What are you...?!
【Mashiro】
You aren't taking him anywhere!
Mashiro forces herself between us.
【Mashiro】
Masaya-senpai belongs to me! And no one else! You hear me?!
【Misaki】
But he belongs to all of us during practice, doesn't he? Though... he might be mine outside of practice too, if I play my cards right.
【Mashiro】
What are you planning to do?!
【Misaki】
What's the problem? Rejoice, Mashiro. The two people you love most in the whole wide world are gonna become <i>real good</i> friends!
【Mashiro】
You and I both know you're not trying to become his <i>friend!</i>
【Misaki】
Come on, Masaya, admit it. You'd love to have these big things all to yourself, wouldn't you?
【Masaya】
S-S-S-S-Stop shoving your boobs against me!
【Mashiro】
Masaya-senpai!
【Masaya】
How is this my fault?!
【Mashiro】
God, I can't believe you, Misaki-senpai. If I'd known you were going to pull this, I would've just left you sulking after our match.
Mashiro... That's a bit over the line...
Well, maybe that's just what their relationship has become. They don't have to worry about upsetting each other with flippant remarks like that.
...For better or worse.
【Masaya】
Come on... No fighting, you two.
【Misaki】
Yeah, sorry...
Misaki smiles sadly.
【Mashiro】
I still feel <i>really</i> bad about what happened to Asuka-senpai in the fall tournament...
【Misaki】
Now we're down to just the three of us. It's a real shame.
【Masaya】
Uh, guys...
【Asuka】
Stop! What are you doing?!
Unable to bear the teasing any longer, Asuka interjects loudly.
【Asuka】
You were arguing seconds ago, so why do you have to team up when it comes to teasing me?! Nothing happened to me! I'm still here!
【Misaki】
One thing <i>didn't</i> happen to you. You didn't win the tournament.
【Asuka】
Ugh, Inui-san is just too good... B-But I'm going to beat her next time, I promise!
【Misaki】
Nah, not a chance. We all know Supreme King Misaki-chan's gonna mop the floor with everyone next tournament!
【Mashiro】
Oh please. It'll be the dark horse--
【Misaki】
You've still got a year after us.
【Mashiro】
I have to wait a whole year for my time to shine?!
The silly banter between our close-knit team never stops.
【Madoka】
I was going to say this earlier, but what's the deal with you saying you're down to three people without Asuka-chan? Surely you didn't forget about your brand new leader, right?
【Masaya】
Don't worry, it was all a part of the joke.
【Madoka】
At least look me in the eye when you're talking to me! I'm begging you!
It's hard to when teasing her is so fun.
【Masaya】
Well, that's enough fooling around. We need to get practice started.
【Misaki】
Let's go, Masaya.
【Asuka】
There's something I want you to teach me, Masaya-san! If you teach me that, I'll help you practice too!
【Madoka】
C'mon, wait up, Hinata-kun!
【Masaya】
Oh boy...
It's even more hectic than before.
【Mashiro】
......
And Mashiro is totally glaring at me.
【Masaya】
At least decide on an order or... Oh.
Mashiro suddenly rushes up to me and takes my hand.
What the hell?
【Mashiro】
Time to fly meowt!
She shouts her activation key, and an anti-gravitation field is deployed around us, since we're holding hands.
Her body slowly floats up into the air at that point.
【Mashiro】
I don't care what order you decide among yourselves, but I come first!
【Masaya】
Huh?
【Mashiro】
Mmmph...!
【Masaya】
What?!
Mashiro's floating body and mine, still rooted to the ground, are connected as her lips touch mine.
The others... What are they making of this?
Instead of looking, I drive those scary thoughts away by focusing on other things.
The beautiful blue of the sky overhead, the sound of the waves in the distance, and the calming smell of the sea breeze.
In this moment, I just want to savor this kiss with my beautiful girlfriend.
Things have finally settled down somewhat after the end of the fall tournament.
And that means Mashiro and I can finally have our long-awaited first date.
【Mashiro】
Senpai, Senpai!
【Masaya】
Yeah.
【Mashiro】
Look, they have a movie theater in here! Isn't that cool?
【Masaya】
...I thought we were having lunch first, Mashiro?
【Mashiro】
But you never know, Senpai! Maybe they have a super awesome movie playing right now?
【Masaya】
I don't know what your definition of "super awesome" is. And in case you need me to remind you, the whole reason we're looking for a place to eat is because you scrapped our initial plan of doing some shopping.
【Mashiro】
I'm sorry! It's just everything seems a lot more fun when I'm with you.
【Masaya】
Yeah, that tends to happen. That's why making plans beforehand is usually the best idea.
【Mashiro】
Wow, is that <i>really</i> the best response you could think of? Say something cool and manly instead like, "I'll let you enjoy everything you want, Mashiro."
【Masaya】
Well, we can do whatever you want, Mashiro. I'm just here to spend time with you.
【Mashiro】
Ah...! I-I'm not going to fall for your sweet talk, Senpai.
【Mashiro】
Do you think there's any private place in this mall where we can go to get some alone time?
【Masaya】
...Don't get all serious and ask me that, Mashiro.
It certainly looks like she fell for it... Not that I was trying to sweet talk her, anyway. I meant every word I said.
【Masaya】
Well, we have the whole day. Let's take it slow. That way, we can relax and enjoy ourselves.
【Mashiro】
Oh, I just remembered. Dad told me to pass on a message to you.
【Masaya】
You really have a low attention span...
【Mashiro】
He wants to know when you'll be back at work.
【Masaya】
......
【Mashiro】
Looks like he's at least acknowledging you, Senpai! Isn't that great?
【Masaya】
I guess...
It's probably a difficult position for a father to be in, so I owe him for handling this in such a mature manner.
【Mashiro】
He also said he's going to teach you everything about making udon, starting with the right amount of flour.
Hm?
【Masaya】
You said he's acknowledging me? Sounds more like he's trying to bring me into the family...
【Mashiro】
I'll let you work out the details with him!
【Mashiro】
What you want to be is up to you. I'll be the wife of an udon chef who married into the family, the wife of an office worker, or even the wife of a professional Skywalker.
【Masaya】
All of those seem a little out of my reach at the moment.
Also, all of those seem to have one thing in common for Mashiro...
But that's not something I mind. I'll do my best to find something that works for both of us.
【Mashiro】
Senpai, Senpai!
【Masaya】
What now? You spot some cute pets at a pet shop or something?
【Mashiro】
Hehehe... Nope, just wanted to call out to my boyfriend.
【Masaya】
......
I can feel myself blushing, so I look away, flustered.
【Mashiro】
Senpai, Senpai!
She tugs at my sleeve.
【Masaya】
I'm not falling for your tricks, Mashiro.
【Mashiro】
I just wanted to say something to you. Thanks for keeping our promises...
【Masaya】
Huh?
Hearing something I least expected, I turn and look back at her.
【Mashiro】
The first, helping me win a match. The second, bringing Misaki-senpai back to FC. And together, helping me defeat Misaki-senpai.
【Mashiro】
I probably wouldn't have managed on my own. I only won thanks to your help.
She's right, but...
【Masaya】
I'm in the same boat, Mashiro. I couldn't have pulled it off without you. It was our combined effort that made it all possible.
【Masaya】
And that's how it'll always be. From now on, we'll always be a team.
We'll assist each other, hand-in-hand, no matter what hardships we face.
That's the kind of relationship we have.
【Masaya】
So you don't have to thank me. Helping you is the natural thing for me to do.
【Mashiro】
Still, it's good to show gratitude. So thank you, Senpai.
【Masaya】
I guess I should too, then. Thanks for keeping our promises, Mashiro.
We both bow our heads and...
【Masaya】
Haha...
【Mashiro】
Hehe...
We look each other in the eye and start laughing. Yeah, that was <i>definitely</i> a little embarrassing.
【Mashiro】
So with that said, it's time for us to put in some effort.
Mashiro moves the conversation forward with that.
【Masaya】
Uh, in what way?
【Mashiro】
Our schedule for the day, duh. We'll go to the movies... No, wait, we'll eat lunch first before that, then go shopping, and after that, we'll check out that pet store you mentioned.
【Masaya】
Listen, Mashiro, there are only so many hours in one day.
【Mashiro】
And after all that, you'll whisper sweet nothings into my ear, gently lead me along, and surprise me with a present or something!
【Masaya】
What kind of fairytale date is this? Like, what sort of present do you want from me, anyway?
【Mashiro】
Hm... Your last name? How about that?
【Masaya】
That'd be a little <i>too</i> much of a surprise...
【Mashiro】
I was just kidding. You already have a very important mission to carry out today. Namely, taking me to all those places!
【Masaya】
So you <i>were</i> serious about that?
So she does want that present too, but she's putting it on hold. Guess I'll keep on the lookout for something else to get her for now.
【Mashiro】
Okay, so first up we have...
We haven't even decided on a place to go, but Mashiro's already walking on ahead. She really can't contain her excitement.
I can't see her face when I'm walking behind her like this...
But even so, I know she's beaming with joy.
【Mashiro】
Let's go, Senpai!
